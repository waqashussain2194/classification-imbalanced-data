0, I like too many songs to have a favorite,0
7279, I used to study French and German at school  but I didn't like them so I didn't pay too much attention lol. Hence why I didn't continue them at later stages in my school life  I chose Art  Music  IT and Graphics instead :D Still methods of communications right? :D,0
7280, Candles :) Candles look AMAZINGGGG! Especially if its dark out  and thats the only form of light <33333333,0
7281, Lollipop :) Especially seeing as we don't have Candy Canes here...I don't think anyway :/,0
7282, Go for it :),0
7283, Carrrrrr! Especially my Car! :D Its really beautiful with the top down on a hot summers day! <333333 Much more than a horse could give you :) Plus  it gets you places  which today  is rather useful :),0
7284, Oh we already covered this  not over formspring ;),0
7285, I take it you mean flooring? Wood :),0
7286, Cheddar. The longer the word  the better :),0
7287, CHOCOLATE! But Vanilla ice cream :),0
7288, Hmmm  Im going to say  whatever you wanted to put into it :) They are your creation  and anything you make me will be DELICIOUS! <3333 Thank you by the way. I feel I should bake some in return  but its going to be nothing in comparisment  and I would probably embarrass myself :P,0
7289, Clubs :) Especially if you are out to let loose a little. I don't have much confidence so when I have been drinking (not loads) just enough to increase my confidence a bit :) Bars  I find a bit....slow? lol Also  going to a club with a partner (not that I have recently  or ever properly :S) but its a nice feeling :) More so than a bar I think :),0
7290, I can... http://kellyblake1.livejournal.com/1641.html There are about 20+ chapters  so continue through my journal to read if you wish :),0
7291, haha! With a lover  ummmm. Completely depends on where we were going  I mean  somewhere known for activities in a cold climate  then cold. I mean  how long can you actually spend on a beach or sunbathing? Its boriiiiiiiiing lol.,0
7292, If it was a random holiday  probably hot :),0
7293, You guessed right! :) Blue to be exact. Favourite colour <333333,0
7294, I probably will sometime XD,0
7295, Romance  but then it reminds me about me being single. Comedy :) lol,0
7278, I can't really no  don't smoke. Don't need to :)  Im sure your fingers must come in handy then :P lol,0
7296, Bed <33333 Couch isn't the most comfiest of places  and a bed just fits all needs ;),0
7277, Indeed I can! been playing for over a decade now XD,0
7275, I don't know if I can handle truthful things sometimes  but I would rather know it :),0
7258, omg  what is it with you and these questions :P Haha  I would say cremated? So my loved one can still keep me I suppose  but being burnt  even if you are dead  its still pretty scary :S I don't have a clue!,0
7259, I didn't either. Then stay in bed :) Do you need to be up for something? If not  stayyyyyyy in bed :),0
7260, ...and some people like both.,0
7261, Well of course :D They are blind because their eyes don't work properly yeah? Wellll  dreams are behind the eye. So they don't even need their eyes :P,0
7262, That was a question  but I will allow another  seeing as this is a question blog ;),0
7263, Considering the next questions in line were  &quot;Would you like me to assign someone to butter your muffin?&quot; and &quot;Is your muffin buttered?&quot;. I may decline. But thank yourself for the offer...,0
7264, Welllllllllll  no.,0
7265, Like this for example...,0
7266, Why not? :) Depending on where im off to of course :P,0
7267, Go for it!!! Im going to rent a place  or my parents are gonna buy something  then we will sell it after. The school is right in the centre  so thats where im staying! WAHOOO!!,0
7268, It can spark creativity  but it depends whether you are stable enough to project it in the right ways. All in all  stay sane  stay projective :),0
7269, If you want to. I don't even have a flat yet  so at the moment  we are all crashing on the wonderful location of outside floor tiles :),0
7270, Hmmmmm....Im not sure. I have scenes from episodes that I love  but Episode 2 of Season 4 is pretty up there. Even if it is very angsty :S,0
7271, Ohhhhh yeah! I was totally going to add you! LOL! The Messenger service I use on my mac doesnt allow me to add people (for some odd reason) I need to add you on my PC  then transfer back to my mac. When im on there  I shall add you :),0
7272, HAHAHA! Well  first of all. Thanks :) I will see what I can do ;),0
7273, Its trickery of the question...,0
7274, &quot;You follow me on Twitter and you are friends with me on Facebook&quot;? Thats like  LOADS of people lol! Ummm  Louise? :/,0
7276, Yeah  I can actually. I have been playing the piano and drums FAR too long! About 10 years for drums and 14ish for piano :),0
7257, bunnies :) They are fluffy and cuddly and everyone loves fluff and cuddles ;),0
7297, Yelling. Because usually crying is painful  yelling can kind of be a denial thing  which isn't so painful :),0
7299, Dark  even though its the hardest to keep on top of  I think dark nails can look gorgeousssss :D,0
7321, Yeah  I think they do. It depends on how much you can relate to that person  there is someone out there who I think my mind relates to prettttttttttty well  and they know who they are :P,0
7322, Did you mean  &quot;do I ever&quot;? In which case  yes I do. I type &quot;lol&quot; FAR too often! Along with &quot;lame&quot; and &quot;cool&quot;. I need to stop using these words. NEEEEEED TO STOP!!!! ITS GETTING LAME!!! COOL? ;),0
7323, Of course. How else do they hear?,0
7324, I bite my nails on occasion  but only if im nervous or something. Bad habits  bad habits  bad habits  ermmmmmm...I don't know if its a habit  but when I get into bed at night  I HAVE to clean the bottom of my feet and/or socks  just in case there is any dirt or anything I have picked up off of the floor. LOL  that may be more of an OCD thing  but I can't get into bed thinking that my feet may be dirty lol.,0
7325, Of course they don't. What's the point in getting dressed? I think they all have bets on to see who wears the best underwear ;),0
7326, I think I am mature for my age  but sometimes I could be spotted being idiotic  which really isn't my age. It depends on what mood im in. I get hyper pretty easily  but I won't show it unless im comfortable with the people I am around. If im with family and close friends  STUPID KELLY COMES OUT :D,0
7327, I am indeed  and I do actually know :) They include just the film and the ending credits. 90 minutes is considered a feature film  so anything WAYYY less  is a phoney excuse for a film :P,0
7328, I actually don't...yet. I want a flower/ivy thing on my foot though  something tasteful :),0
7329, Garry Baldis??? HAHA! Garibaldis? I actually eat garibaldis on a daily basis :P There is about 3 packets in my drawer :) As for biscuits  certain ones yeah. Not the crappy digestive or &quot;nice&quot; ones or anything  cool ones that contain chocolate :P,0
7330, Well yeah! You're awesome! Only one problem  who are you? :) <333,0
7331, Who are you?,0
7332, haha not at all :) Randomness is good :),0
7333, Proper ones shouldn't. It's all in the label...,0
7334, I have never had cereal with warm milk actually. Any good?,0
7335, YES I DO!!!! ;),0
7336, I don't think i have ever had that if im honest. I have had it  where you have had a conversation or moment with someone  and then everytime you meet  speak to or see them again  you expect that same 'connection' thing to happen  and when it doesn't  you are utterly disappointed :(,0
7337, I don't really no. I don't think things can be moved or changed due to someones will. If you mean magic in the sense of chemistry between 2 people  then hell yessssss :P,0
7320, Sand :) although I don't really want either lol,0
7298, Laura Williams :) Year 7 at school :D,0
7319, non-digital :P Analogue yeah? I think clocks can be really pretty and expressive  but digital is so literal  where is the love???? lol,0
7317, I MISSED YOU!!!! *Cries uncontrollably* :(,0
7300, Can I do a Skins relation? lol Emily :) She is  to me  the PERFECT girlfriend! Yeah  she can sometimes be a little much or suffocating  but its only because she cares about the girl that she loves. As for looks  I don't really date someone based on their looks. Its about personality for me. Obviously I need that initial attraction  but I don't have a 'type' as such to fall for :),0
7301, Best kiss? You mean as in my kissing style?  Well I prefer kind of sensual kisses? As in (I can't believe I am describing my kissing style LOL) slower and meaningful ones? Obviously to keep a relationship alive then it needs to be varied but Im not a big fan of kisses where the other person sticks their tongue down your throat :S Especially if its really forceful and you aren't in 'that' kind of mood. You know what I mean? :S How about you anyway? :P This was an awkward question  im returning it :P,0
7302, Druken Master ;) I am a pro at my fights ;) HAHA,0
7303, Drunk :'( Well  girl or guy?  Girl wasn't really much  and the guy  drunk :P lol!,0
7304, HAHAHAHA! Well you would have to just wait and see ;) HAHA I can't believe I just wrote that! I don't know really  I mean I have never really made it  so I suppose  a pout and a wink with a nice snarl ;) haha. Joking again :P Ummm  I dunno really. It would vary from time to time :) How about yours?,0
7305, HAHA! Go for it if you really want to ;) lol I don't mind answering :P My favourite necklace? Ummm  I don't know if I really have one if im honest. Im one of those people who would like to own a lot of something (eg jewellery) than have one really expensive item. I do have one necklace that I REALLY love! Its from Urban Outfitters  and its a little gold envelope  that has a letter inside saying &quot;Cest La Vie&quot; meaning &quot;This is life&quot; or &quot;That's life&quot; in French :),0
7306, HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! No comment... :P,0
7307, Hmmm  my Garden. Well it has 2 sections to it.  It starts off with a pond and a patio area  then the first section is long and narrow (ish) and goes all the way to a square shapped holey trellace thing. Its all covered in grass  but then around the edges are flower beds and trees. If you go to the end of the garden and turn left  there is more kind of around the corner  behind our garage. Then it goes onto a raised patio platform thing with a swing chair thing and it goes a little more along the back (length ways). That doesn't make ANY SENSE! Here :) lol http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=11088742&amp;id=750810466 It goes on a bit longer  and goes around the corner a little at the top and bottom. Its an odd shape  so its hard to explain :P,0
7308, My house? Well  my family own 5  but I assume the one that I live in now? Its a detached bungalow with a loft conversion. Its rather cool actually  in the front left and right corners  we have turrets (in my bedroom and the dining room) which make it look slightly like a castle :D My drum kit is in one of the turrets  and I think it fits nicely :)  Then we have a wooden balcony thing overlooking the garden. The Garden is made up of 2 sections really. Its a long stretch of land thing  then at the end  you turn left and it goes back and along slightly  hard to explain really lol.,0
7309, Get up  make a drink. Drink the drink  sort out something to wear  get dressed then wash. Eat some toast  tidy my room and do my make up then hair. Thats about it for the morning :),0
7310, My voice??? Ummm... I have been told my quite a few people  that I have quite a nice voice. I speak quite clearly  and I don't think I really have a regional accent  obviously an English accent  but I don't sound Bristolian or anything (at least I don't think I do). I suppose Im softly spoken  and its been said that I have a slightly lower pitched voice? I dunno lol...,0
7311, My mum does too. Just cant handle your peppermint...,0
7312, I don't think so  but hey hey  I can handle it :P I should probably go to sleep now actually :(,0
7313, REALLY???!??!?!??!?!!? OMG! Thats...bad :/ Still worth having them though  you think? I think that your seat should have them too  and push you up out of the roof. How cooooool would that look?! Car crash (not cool) and you pop out the top! LOL! *tries to stop oneself from laughing at the image* O_O,0
7314, Probably because you microwave it too long. Make it 10 seconds less  and your throat muscles will be fine :),0
7315, What?! No way!! Im glad I didn't get tickets then. How come she pulled out? :(,0
7316, Why not? :) Although I can't promise an answer tonight  I think im too tired and can't really be bothered to use my brain at the moment. Im not even thinking of my answers  just letting my hands do the typing  and this is what is coming out.... :D,0
7318, No I didn't  I was driving. It was last night yeah?,0
7256, BUFFY! I liked both  but I loved the characters in Buffy more :D,0
7255, I don't really have a preference. But if I had to choose  blondes :),0
7254, I have never been to Brighton for a long period of time. For now  Bristol :),0
7194, Definitely a light sleeper. I wake up at the smallest thing  and its crap because I have problems sleeping anyway  so it results in very littttttle sleep :(,0
7195, Not really. Again  because of my insomnia  when I get up  im usually pretty tired  but I tend to snap out of it as time goes on. It's actually annoying  it might be 7 at night  and Im really tired  but by the time it reaches 11 or something  I AM A HYPER LITTLE THING. Rather irritating considering thats normal peoples bedtime-ish...,0
7196, Pretty much yeah lol. With some things  no  but if its shit stuff  YESSSSS! I get distracted easily :P,0
7197, Umm  I would say so yes. I mean  with odd things (eg  shall I try jumping from here to there  but there is a steep drop that I would probably fall down in the middle  then no) but I still like to take some risks with things  otherwise whats the point? Everything would be boring :( Just the usual kind of stuff  I guess its called trying your luck? lol,0
7198, Im not to an extent. I have never seen anything really squeamish in real life  so I only have to base it on TV things. I can watch most things  but there are odd (about 3 times in my life) where I have actually had to look away. A scene from Pathology being one :S Saw 3 being another and The Descent 2 being the last :),0
7199, I don't think I really understand that question o_O,0
7200, Im not no  but I could quite easily give up meat. I do agree with vegetarianism but because I still live with my family  its difficult to live like it :(,0
7201, Not really no lol. Are you?,0
7202, I am VERY sarcastic! I suppose it depends on who I am talking to  because it bounces off more with different people. But generally  yeah DEFINITELY! Are you? :),0
7203, I am indeed :) As of about 10/15 mins ago  but Twitter is over capacity and I can't tweet :( Managed to get out a bit early >>> *does happy dance* :D,0
7204, Im close to certain members of my family yes. I don't really get on too well with my dad or sister  and I do have a pretty small family  so at least that enables us to be a little closer :),0
7205, Im 10 people?! LOL!  RUDDDDDDDEEEEE MUCH!!!! :P,0
7206, Maybeeeee a little ;);),0
7207, Whats 'Shed'?,0
7208, I think im pretty good at making friends  yeah definitely  but I'm not great at making those really close friends you know? I can make friends  that i pass time with  but I wouldn't consider them life changing or that special to me.,0
7209, I try to :) I don't know if I am  but the approach I usually take (in person) is the stupid one lol. I can be really really stupid if  want to be  not like slapstick  I just make stupid comments that generally make people laugh. So  I hope so :) I think you're going to have to ask them  but it is my intention. Unless im pissed off with them  then they don't deserve to be smiling at me lol.,0
7210, With taking or following? Im not great with either  but im not the worst :) I usually end up lost wherever I go  so im pretty much used to getting lost around Bristol and sorting out my semi-crisis  lol.,0
7193, Oh god yes! lol! I love cuddles!!!! <333333! I know you do too  so I don't need to return that question :P,0
7211, Whats up with that?,0
7192, Night  DEFINITELY! Night is when I come aliveeeeeee. In more ways that one ;) haha,0
7190, HAHA! I guess they are! SO  does that mean when we're playing the game &quot;Guess who?&quot; and you say &quot;Does he have facial hair?&quot; the answer would always be &quot;yes&quot; lol. Unless they are facially bald :/,0
7173, If im honest. I am bloody thankful my parents are NOT on Twitter.  As for the questions  I think its slightly wrong that they are even asking them  you think? I shall dodge if need be the really &quot;ahem&quot; ones :P lol,0
7174, Indeed :D,0
7175, *flushed out with a pint of water and loveeeeeeeee* <3333 :),0
7176, CHAMBORD LIQUOR!!! :D Aka rasberry liquor. HEAVENLY!,0
7177, My last answer about birthday dates is  well  if im honest. That helmet wont fit anymore :/,0
7178, Well congrats! Buttttt  I think someone should be doing their homework  am I correct? ;) Not reading all my formspring answers :) But yeah  do a video with some Italian words :P Pleaseeeeee?,0
7179, I agree then. Because Carla does know all. We must agree  she is the lord :),0
7180, Ohhh I see. A nice random playlist you have going there :),0
7181, Im going to need a clue if Im gonna get this. Someone obviously a tad perverted ;) lol!,0
7182, Haha awww! Everyone cool is accident prone  so no worries ;) Im pretty bad too  but that just makes us awesome :P haha,0
7183, Good good good. I will let you know dates and the basic script of shouting...I MEAN PREACHING :P,0
7184, Asking :) Probably because I like to find out things about certain people ;) buttttttttt its hard when you can't think of anything to ask  and you end up coming across like a babbling idiot ;),0
7185, Only my lobes. I want to get a few more done on my ears  just regular ones going up and a scaffold piercing on my right ear  BUT I don't like needles. So its a bit of an issue :( For years  I have wanted my tongue and my lip pierced (in the centre) but again  its a needle :'(,0
7186, Oh thats a secret  I don't think I can be posting that on here ;) haha!,0
7187, HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! Well  im pretty sensual  so I just find light touches to the skin or something  really relaxing. It might sound cheesy but heyyyyyy  also  neck...works well :P lol,0
7188, House definitely. Depending on Location  but I would say a house :),0
7189, Oh trust me! Im picking ALL the less-naughty ones! LOL! You should see the ones im deleting :S,0
7191, Indeed. Some are made of the same material they make fake eyes out of. I don't mean glass. I mean that rubbery stuff..whats the word? Oh yeah! Blu Tack...,0
7212, No comment.,0
7213, Probably my mum. She is more sensitive  and I think Im a pretty sensitive person. Im like my dad too though  in the sense he gets his mind on something  and likes to stick to it :),0
7214, Errrm  isn't that the same thing? Well  I would say a cook  because I like to experiment a little :) I do like to bake deserts though...hmmm....,0
7237, Probably going to say Skins Filming. Only because it was cool  and I made it that much cooler ;) lol,0
7238, I shall make this my last one before bed :) Its gone 4:15  but its you  so I can't turn you away :P I would say a horror movie  because it enables you to snuggle and get a little closer. BUT nothing that would make me feel sick or anything  like the Saw movies (seen any of them?). Perhaps a psychological horror  something that I would want my partner to stay with me afterwards  to protect me ;) haha. How about you then? :D,0
7239, Chicken :),0
7240, Ummmmm  hard to say. Because there are so many different types of illustration. Probably some work that I did in My Foundation year at Graphics :),0
7241, HELL YESSS! I mean  Im not a huge Beyonce fan (personally) Im not really a fan of her music  but she has to be one of the most talented performers out there :),0
7242, Small :),0
7243, mammals :) They are more reachable. I couldn't live without my cats anymore  and as they are mammals  then mammals :),0
7244, Oh  my room is boring! lol! My bed is really comfy though  right? :),0
7245, hmmm  well everyone has the black one  but the white one could get really dirty and scratched and be really obvious...hmmm. I would say  the white one :) If it gets dirty  buy a new case :),0
7246, Well I don't think anyone is black or white. Everything is kind of mixed  we are all grey in one way or another :),0
7247, Depends on what :) I prefer white toast to burnt  I prefer black clothing to white clothes  and race wise  doesn't matter :),0
7248, WTF!!!! HAHAHAHAHA! Cracking me up. Get it? Get the pun there? ;),0
7249, Films,0
7250, &quot;7 hours ago&quot; I really hope you aren't still bored  therefore my help is not needed :),0
7251, Im good to cure that boredom now :),0
7252, TOASTTTT!!! But it has to be buttered STRAIGHT away  so that it melts in all nicely :),0
7253, Dark room  DEFINITELY! Bright light? Just shows up things that don't need to be there. Plus  with a dark light  makes you anticipate more :) ANTICIPATION IS THE KEY :D,0
7236, Haha! Seriously? What happened???? :P,0
7235, Ohhh I see :( The straight issue. Yeah  we have all been there  it happens to the best of us. With straight people  its not healthy to get hung up on them  so I can see why you want to get it out of your system. Talking through it can help  plus concentrating your feelings on something else can help :) Aka  keeping distracted lol. Literally  try not to think of her like that too. You know? Although its not as hard as that to say I know :(,0
7234, Is Action Man an option? I never had a barbie  I was the Action Man girl :D lol,0
7233, Smut ftw indeedo!!! :P,0
7215, Hmmmm  well it completely depends on how hungry I am.  If im hungry  real food  but I must admit I have a thing for sweet things XD CHEESECAKE!!!!! <333333 My love :D lol I think I prefer sweet things to savory yeah  but only at a push ;),0
7216, I have never really been that political. I voted for the labour party in the local election last year  and im pretty sure they won  but again  I don't really keep up on politics :P,0
7217, Only traditional in the romantic sense :P lol As in  I believe people shouldn't get married unless terribly in love (and not because of arranges or because of children etc)  and to treat your guy/girl with respect and never let them down etc etc etc You know where im going with this lol.,0
7218, IM READY!!!! *takes off gloves  and adjusts seat*,0
7219, I would like to think so yeah :) I would consider myself kind  helpful and caring  which are qualities that I look for in other people if I were making friends :),0
7220, It depends really.  If I wasn't sure how the other person felt  then I would probably leave it until I know that they felt about me like that. If I knew they did  then I could potentially yes  it all depends on the moment and things :),0
7221, Hmmm  I am pretty ticklish yes :P Down the sides of my stomach I am VERY VERY VERY ticklish! Any soft movements there and I squirm  haha! Im quite ticklish on my feet too  and underarms  but thats probably normal :) Are you at all?,0
7222, No. My name is Earl :) well  not really watching  but its on in the background. My TV never leaves E4. No specific reason really ;) I can never be assed to change the channel :P,0
7338, Umm  well I wouldn't say that I really believe in them  but I don't like to take my chances either lol. As for the stepping on cracks  or walking under a ladder  thats probably bull crap  but still  little things like &quot;swearing on someones life&quot; or smashing a mirror  I get a little creaped at :P How about you?,0
7223, Last time I checked  I was ALL female :),0
7225, the sphere?,0
7226, HAHA! Well  Im not a lover of the Over the top dresses  so I would want to wear a dress  but a kind of plain-ish one  and my fiance could wear whatever they wanted to wear. As long as they were happy  I would be happy :),0
7227, We are always good enough. To strive for something that may or may not happen  it means you are pretty likely to be disappointed by the results. All in all  don't try to change  you would never be disappointed  and would even be happier with something that you MAY have always wanted. Who knows :),0
7228, I don't think they is really such thing as normal. But if I was to attempt to define it  then &quot;Normal could be defined as something that is socially acceptable  and would be considered 'the norm'. Its something that the majority of people live by. Anything different would be considered &quot;unusual&quot; therefore  not normal&quot;...,0
7229, Hmmm  Snog Kathryn Prescott  Marry You (:P) and Avoid My sister :P,0
7230, Nah its okay. No problem :) Its why I don't sleep around like some of my friends do. I don't believe in it :),0
7231, Love you toooooo! The love is back!!!! <3333333 XD,0
7232, body odour. Bad breath  really puts me off lol,0
7224, You only just noticed? ;),0
7339, Umm  I don't know what I believe really. I think there is more to life than this though. Than living  dying  the end. I just don't know what.,0
7340, I would like to believe in those things  it is a really nice thought. However  there are some people who seem to get the good things happen to them constantly  no matter of how they treat others. So  No :(,0
7341, I suppose this is kind of the same as my last,0
7449, Yes. But in an odd sense  they also remind you that you are so fragile and anything can be a turning point in your life  and I don't just mean physically :),0
7450, No  of course not :) Do you mean with myself or in a partner or friend? If im talking partners  then I actually prefer someone who is a shorter than me. Only because I like to be protective and look after my loved one  so if they're shorter than me  I can envelope them :D lol,0
7451, Bother me? Its how you become a celebrity today ;) Don't do things by yourself  its who you date or marry that make you famous :P lol,0
7452, No. The act of sex  in a relationship is a big part of showing your love for someone  its about sharing a connection  you know? Sex however  isn't love  and anyone who think so  should be shot :P,0
7453, Haha  it depends on what you are talking about ;) lol For some people I suppose it does  but with me  it really doesnt. With everything I mean  any certain...parts  doesn't matter  height of a partner or friend  doesn't matter  So no. Size  in anything  I don't give a shit :),0
7454, DOLPHINS DON'T KILL OR EAT YOU :),0
7455, Only ones that come into my restaurant and end up in the section that Im serving  yes.,0
7456, OMG! You know when he is looking and singing through the letterbox? I think someone should have been the other side of it with a twig. That would have gone down nicely with a twig in the eye ;),0
7457, Window :) For example  your lover coming in through the window <33333 lol,0
7458, HAHA! Your answer to this question made me laugh! The car that I really wanted  (before I settled with mine) was a 5 dr Toyota Rav 4 :P In light metallic blue with grey bumpers! Made me laugh that we wanted the same one lol!  So anyway  my dream car  do you mean affordable or in a dream world? I will say both :) If money wasn't an option  I would probably choose something like a porshe Carrera GT Cabriolet  only because <333333333 But in the real world  I am happy to say I own my dream car :D A New Beetle Cabriolet. I have it in light metallic blue and have blue and white flowers/birds down the side. If I could change the colour  I would. I LOVEEEEEEE the dark metallic navy one  with the cream leather. I would actually jizz if I ever bought one like that! LOL! It costed me just over u00a37 000 and that was a lot of money for me having just turned 19  but I saved up and managed to get it :) The insurance is a bitch though  but luckily its fairly economical to run :) I also really wanted to own a Jeep Wrangler Golden Eagle in Black  but they came out last year I think  and its far too much money for me to spend on a car. Besides  they devalue really easily  and rust quite badly :(,0
7459, Well if you mean the legal kind  then gooood! Because they are there to help you  if you mean the illegal kind  not good  although I can see why people give into them unfortunately :(,0
7460, right...,0
7461, Same thing :P lol!,0
7462, HAHAHAHA! Thats defense right there :P,0
7463, Even. At least everyone has a pair :),0
7464, No  but I have never really been in a serious relationship  so I guess the two don't go together?,0
7465, I just Loled! Im worried about you. I really am.,0
7448, I work at the moment  but I do independent projects on the side. I have a place at Brighton Film School for september  so I will return to education then :),0
7466, Yes  far too many :S All with my sister though LOL! Its been UGLYYYYYY! Although  I Was at school  and I got into a fight with my best friend over something. I can't even remember what is was about. No one was hurt  but it involved bottles of fruit juice being trown at each other. Pretty funny looking back  not at the time seeing as I was a walking insect trap...,0
7447, I think I have worn them when I have driven somewhere to pick someone up. But I never got out of the car  and I think it was only once. Thats not too bad right? :),0
7445, Well I assume you mean bag? Because a purse over here  is like a wallet lol. In which case  I do yes :) Sometimes if Im just popping out for 10 minutes or something  then no  but it depends on where I am going and what I need to take :),0
7427, I guess. But none right now :),0
7428, Everyone from leicester is 'onit' for everyone. It clouds my judgement  so yes :) I ship you all with all all. How entertaining :P,0
7429, It has a certain ring to it ;) lol,0
7430, oh hell yeah! Real people just extend our shipping abilities :),0
7431, Oh god no!!! I can't STAND smoking! The smell of it  the taste of it...its a no no. How about you?,0
7432, I don't know lol. It's been a while since anyone has been able to let me know. I don't think I snore though  because I have been on holiday with family  and no one complained about any snoring  only from my father  but I think thats just dads in general :P,0
7433, Sometimes I guess  but isn't everyone? If I do  I always have a valid reason :),0
7434, HAHA! It's funny you asked that actually! I do yes  and when I Was at the Lady Gaga gig  there was a curtain that came down in front of the stage  and video was projected onto the curtain. Because I was RIGHT at the front  I was looking directly up to it  and when I started screaming  I could feel my tonsils vibrating in the back of my throat lol!! I thought I was swallowing them! HAHAHA! Not a nice feeling :S,0
7436, LONG SHOWERS!!! I don't know how its possible to take a short shower lol. The hot water and steam? Mmmmm :),0
7437, I prefer showers at night  okay because it gets me all cosy for bed and stuffffff. Besides  showers in the morning are usually COLDDDDD :(,0
7438, Oh yes definitely. Well  I know that they make every girl want to have their own price charming. The princes in fairytales  don't exist in real life  or at least not very often  so to think 'the girl always gets the perfect prince' isn't a very good representation of real life :(,0
7439, Do you ever not look cool? Is it possible?,0
7440, I like yours purple  only because you still look like you. Louse looked like some random devil being thing :/,0
7441, No they aren't. You perhaps aren't looking in the right places :) You will find her  she is out there somewhere :),0
7442, No :P It gets harder  but there are always things to find out. Perhaps a limit to things you want to know  but hey ho....its a challenge :P,0
7443, I don't think im sexy at all! lol I don't have very much confidence  and I think the biggest part of being sexy  is exerting a body confidence.  I suppose that can change in time  but for the moment. No lol.,0
7444, I think I trust FAR too easily! It means I tend to get hurt more than people who don't let people in. What does it gain you in the end though? Nothing :(,0
7446, Yeah I definitely want kids. I don't know when or how  (obviously it cant be the traditional way) but I would only want them when Im settled in a steady relationship  with a heathy income  and im able to look after them. I have no preference over a girl or a boy  but whenever the time is right  either would be fantastic :),0
7467, Not yet no lol,0
7468, I have yeah  a few times actually. Im not the biggest fan of clowns though so I don't know why :/,0
7469, I have yes  2 times actually. Once with friends (college) and once with my family. I enjoyed the first one more  obviously ;) But I was too young to really go out and enjoy myself :( I still am too young to drink over there  but heyyy  I'm in England. I can make up for it here :),0
7492, Ohhhh! Well V-Card was like  &quot;Valentines Card&quot; or thats what everyone used as short  then it was Virgin Card  and I was like &quot;the credit card?&quot; :/ Okay okay okay  got it now! LOL! Well  I wish I was. Does that explain?,0
7493, Burping lol. THATS RANDOM! :P,0
7494, Dolphin :D But that would be a taddddd difficult ;),0
7495, Ummmm  domestically or in general? Well I LOVE dolphins  they are just so beautiful and graceful :) as for domestically  I actually wasn't a cat person  but I have to say cats now  only because I love mine too much <333333,0
7496, Cadburys :) or Nestle. Probably equal :),0
7497, The Descent :) (first one  second doesn't even come into it).,0
7498, Probablyyyyyy homemade Lasagne :) I LOVEEEE IT! and homemade is just bravissimo! :D,0
7499, Ummmm  depends on what mood im in  but I would say rock or acoustic or something :) Im quite into Electronic but I do need to be in a certain mood for that :) Easy listening stuff would do me :),0
7500, I have been on  or want to take? The favourite holiday I have taken  would have to be the first time when I went to Orlando with my family. I was pretty young  about 10 or something  and well  a kid let loose in Orlando? CAUSES A RIOT ;) lol,0
7501, Lilies :D The Tiger Lily is just <3 :D,0
7502, Hmmm  I don't know if I have one  but I have a least favourite month? I HATE January  only because the hype of Christmas is over  and everyone makes so many things about the new year  which usually gets broken within the first week lol. Besides  this year  January really wasn't a good month :( So  best would be  June? BECAUSE ITS WHEN WE GET HEAT! Hopefully...lol,0
7503, Hmmm  probably now  because my parents have gone to bed  and I can do what I want to without getting moaned at :D WOOP! No one needs the moaning :P,0
7504, Probably now :) Because its when my family go to bed  and I have free reign of the house! Mwah ha ha ha ha ha...,0
7505, Australian  I just love it XD,0
7506, I don't actually read all that often  I get distracted easily so my attention span can be short on things unless im really into it :) I tend to read informational books though (that makes me sound like a geek  but buggar it! GEEKS ARE IN! :D),0
7507, I didn't really understand most of this question  but I will salvage what I can from it lol. Favourite colour  I would say blue :) Favourite colour to wear is probably dark grey. Only because it goes with my hair AMAZINGLY :D In jewellery  I would say perhaps dark blue and gold? I know blue and yellow technically contrast  but what can I say? I love them together :D,0
7508, Salt n Vinegar! :D Although  I have always thought they taste exactly the same as Pickled onion. Hmmm  I could be wrong...,0
7491, I am confuseddddd (doesn't help that I don't answer them in order does it? :P),0
7490, Hmmm  its more difficult when answering it isn't it? haha Would I... Of course :) If you wanted to  indeed :D I live to please (not like that HAHA) people  so its nice to make others happy :D,0
7489, Ummm  I don't know  I really don't keep track lol. Im always telling my family that I love them  because I think its VERY important for someone to be reminded of how they feel  especially seeing as you don't know what can happen from one day to the next.  Including romantic love  a little while lol.,0
7488, Yeah  I have done on occasion. Usually while drunk or out of it of sorts lol... Joking  but yeah  I have.,0
7470, I don't think I have no  well unless that includes Skull? lol. I broke my skull open once :/ Wasn't pretty :(,0
7471, I don't think I have no  but I have been broken in the past  but its all about getting back up again :),0
7472, No  I don't think so. Thank God. You?,0
7473, I can't say that I have no  even if the house was empty  no thanks :) I like wearing clothes  lets stick to that :),0
7474, No lol. All the floors in my house (apart from the upstairs  but I never really go up there anyway) are wooden or tiled  so its not the nicest and most comfortable place to fall asleep :S I don't think I have done it while drunk either. If im drunk  and I eventually go to bed  I actually have real problems getting to sleep (not that I don't anyway lol). But I can't switch off :( and not because the room is spinning or anything  just can't get to sleep :( Then I wake up extra early  all in all  pretty sucky :P,0
7475, Yes  many times. But I think everyone has those feelings. The ones where you're like. &quot;Is that normal?&quot;  but by saying that  makes you normal  because everyone has their insecurities  its just about opening up about them :),0
7476, No lol. Crazy golf  hell yeah! but not the standard &quot;lets stand and decide on which direction to hit our ball in before deciding which bag of clubs to use&quot; type :P,0
7477, Once. But I had taken E  and I was a bit out of it. I woke up  with a GUY (Shudders) next to me  but I don't know what happened. HELL YES I regret it :(,0
7426, Too many things. If I could go back and change things in my past  I would  and I would probably be a completely different person for it. But there is no point in dwelling right? I think I turned out reasonably okay :),0
7478, No  any good? :),0
7480, Perhaps occasionally :P Involving a certain Loveless actress ;) HAHA!,0
7481, Yes. Its times when one thing happens  and it causes you to question everything else  kind of like a Domino effect. Thats why its important to trust the right people  and to close up with certain things (even though I can never seem to do that) :(,0
7482, No  and I can't say I have ever intended to..,0
7483, Yes  the same with laughter too. You don't know why you are laughing  but the more you think about it  the more you laugh. Its rather funny  to watch and to experience :P Ever had it?,0
7484, Yes lol  thats normally the point where I stop asking until more things pop back in... Kind of like eating if you think about it? &quot;I'm hungry  give me food...I don't want anymore food  stop feeding me. I'm hungry again  feed me...&quot; Okay  you get my gist... lol,0
7485, No  but I sometimes think I perhaps should...,0
7486, haha! I have actually  but only randomally strapping them on because they feel weird  then under 59 seconds later  they are off again. Thats the extent of my useage. Random? lol,0
7487, I would like to be a tattoo designer  thats cool  but never the tattooist. I couldn't handle peoples blood on me (even if its through gloves) lol.,0
7479, Ummm  once I think. I was pushed down some concrete steps in my old house BY MY SISTER and my skull was cracked open. I was only little  and I had to go to hospital and get is stapled back together :S,0
7172, Which question? It doesn't help when you post without leaving a name ;),0
7425, OF COURSE! Skins isn't long enough  so we need to prolong it somehow :),0
7423, Sketching is my life lol. and painting  yes I do :) There are some random sketches on my Twitpic account if you are interested :),0
7363, Well  I don't have a plan as such  because I think it varies with each person. I mean  if the person I was dating was shaky say  then I would be more reluctant to start a family with them  but it could change later in like  and I actually get married to them. I would like to have kids by the time I am 40 though lol! Married by mid 30's? the latest?  Im not big on dates or anything  it just depends on when the right person comes along :),0
7364, OMG! Imagine if I didn't! Wow! Terrible :( So  yes I do :),0
7365, I don't actually :) Im pretty easily going when it comes to allergies :) Im lucky :D,0
7366, I have the normal  heights  dark (to an extent)  dying alone  loosing loved ones etc etc etc. But my worst fear  is COCKROACHES!!! Well insects in general  but cockroaches are EUGHHHH! :'( If I see one  even behind glass  I freak out.,0
7367, Only cockroaches  but I don't think thats strange :P Ohhhhh  and dust  but thats more a cleanliness thing.,0
7368, I don't wear glasses  but I do have a couple of pairs of glasses with just plastic in the lenses :P They look cool  but one  Geek glasses! HELLLO! <<< COOLESS! XD,0
7369, I never actually did the whole wedding planning thing. I haven't thought much about what I want my wedding to be like either. I want it to be more about the person  rather than all the material things that I don't deem as a priority :),0
7370, I have a Livejournal  but I don't really update it that regularly :(,0
7371, Shame I dont edit my life to sort out your entertainment issues isnt it? :P,0
7372, Of course. Im me  that makes me special :),0
7373, I have a surf board  but its never been in water. Does that count? :P,0
7374, Spoonerism? Being clever with words of something?,0
7375, No Idea. Sounds fictional :/,0
7376, I do.,0
7377, Long questions definitely  only because it means I can get all my opinions out onto the page  rather than this or that.  They feel more worth wile :),0
7378, Indeed :) But no a scary amount  just a normal amount lol,0
7379, I do! But only cooked. Not raw because they are hard to swallow  and also chewy :/ As a result  EWWWW! lol,0
7362, Hmmmm  Kel? lol Im not a nickname kind of person. Unluckily  my name rhymes with a few not so nice things  so I went through all the smelly  welly  telly  belly jokes at school lol. There is one name that my mum calls me  for some random reason  called 'Fred'. I have NO idea why  may name is not Winifred  but still she continues to call me it. Its suck now  but I think its a mum thing and anyone else using it would be weird :/,0
7380, I have four  but that doesn't necessarily mean I like them all the time. 96% of the time  they are in my good books  quite opposite to the lie detector result of that on Jeremy Kyle right? ;),0
7361, I never really did the lucky number thing  sorry.,0
7359, FARRRR TOO EASILYYYYY! :( I sometimes feel a bit walked over because of it too. My theory is  if you love someone that much  you would rather forgive than forget them :(,0
7342, I do actually. Well I believe that this life cannot be the end. I think there is something after our lives  but I wouldn't know what. How about you? Any beliefs?,0
7343, I wish it did  and I think that things can happen to people that make them a better person  but only because they choose to learn from their mistakes. So  I think it can happen for a reason  its all about making the most of the things that do happen :),0
7344, I would like to think that yes  but unfortunately I don't think it works that way :(,0
7345, I was  but I kind of go back and fourth. It depends on what is happening in my life at that point. I would say yes  but things can affect me really easily. Usually with other people  perhaps doing or saying something rather upsetting :(,0
7346, Oh God no! That creeps me out! Besides being REALLY bad for your bones  it sounds horrible :S Do you?,0
7347, I don't really day dream no  I haven't for yearssss I don't think actually :),0
7348, I don't think so. But there again  I go through phases. Sometimes it takes me weeks to have another dream  but then other times  its daily. Odd.,0
7349, Oh god yes! I know lots of people today  are totally skipping marriage  and I don't really think that it changes much in someones relationship. However  marriage is about loyalty to each other  and I love that :) I wouldn't want a marriage to change my life from how it was before though (if that makes sense?)  I don't think a certificate saying that you both are legally now joined should change the way you treat each other. Getting married can also take a spark out of a relationship  and thats sad :(,0
7350, I do indeed! :D I check for answers of any question that I post  no point in asking them otherwise is there? :P,0
7351, Frequently :(,0
7352, Yes  all the time! My moods change a lot (not in a bad way)  I just mean that I could be normal one minute (whatever normal is) and the next  really hyper. So when I go all hyper  I can imagine myself annoying the person im chatting to. Do you think im annoying? lol,0
7353, Yeah  I do. But then I would also fancy Canadians (;))  English  Scottish  irish  welsh  French  Italian  australians  etc etc etc..you see where im going with this :P NOT THAT I FANCY EVERYONE! lol  I just mean  they dont HAVE to be American :P,0
7354, No.,0
7355, No.,0
7356, Not really no lol. My head is a bit muddled with everything at the moment  so try asking me in a couple of years :),0
7357, I think I do get along with most people pretty easily. I think older people  are probably the least I get on with (older as in 10 years ish) because I clash a little with my views  opinions etc. I definitely get along with my own age group  and younger people the same  if not better :) Sorry  that was a boring answer :/,0
7358, I actually don't :( I tend to have to drink WAY more than my friends before I feel the affects of alcohol :( I think my tally once was about 15 vodka/cokes and I still wasn't that drunk. Only tipsy :( I eventually gave up lol!,0
7360, I hate a lot of things when it hurts  not just a rib digging in :),0
7381, Umm  not really. DEFINITELY not in chocolate bars :S I like pure chocolate  pure sweetness is enough,0
7382, You butter your fish? lol! Im not really a big fish fan actually. I like some  though  eg  tuna  cod and salmon. But thats about it. I hate strong tasting fish too. Definitely not a fan :(,0
7383, Granite? As in tiles and stuff? Well yeah  I guess :( RANDOM! lol. It makes the kitchen work tops look nice :),0
7406, I do :D But I prefer private pools rather than public ones. Im not really a fan of swimming in the sea because im always afraid a crab will grab my feet LOL,0
7407, Oh yeah DEFINITELY! I am more a fan of the traditional ones though. For example  cheese  or cheese and ham  chicken and sweetcorn. I CANNOT stand spicy foods  of any sort  so anything spicy on a pizza and I wont eat any of it :(,0
7408, Turtles are the cutest things ever!! Don't you think? :D,0
7409, I actually do yes :) They are like slippers only for outside :D Its funny you said that because I have a pair on right now  only because I managed to drip all over my slippers when I got out of the shower  and they need to dry off :(,0
7410, Yes lol! I like the comfort that clothes give you  they make you warm and cosy. Who can argue with that? :),0
7411, I do  but only when I concentrate on it. If I scribble something quickly  then it ends up looking a mess. When I am doing a piece of writing  I tend to start off neatly  and as I get more into it  I write quicker  and it starts to turn to scribbling :P,0
7412, I like a little of both if im honest. More than anything  I want to be happy  and I think love/family makes up a big part of that. So  I definitely want the big family thing  but I would still want a little independance from it? If that makes sense? Only in the case  to spend it away from the kids and with the one that I loved :),0
7413, I actually do quite like my last name yeah? Do you like it? I have to be honest  and say I have never really thought about it but still  thinking now  yeah I do :) Its short and straight to the point lol! I like your name! Its so cute :),0
7414, I think my laugh could be a lot worse :P I don't really have a stand out laugh at all really  I sometimes can giggle pretty funny but I haven't had any comments on it either. So thats probably a good thing :),0
7415, I do :) Who doesn't love a massage? :D But only from my girlfriend (if I had one)  I would find it awkward going to a salon or whatever lol,0
7416, I LOVE YOU!!!! <333,0
7417, I love lots of people :)  What can I sayyyy  im a very loving person :),0
7418, I love the Brizzle. The question is  do you?,0
7419, I do  but I think its going down  like how much I miss them. Which is a good thing :D,0
7420, No  thanks. Im cool :),0
7421, Actually I prefer not to listen to music when I sleep  only because then I get songs stuck in my head  then I can't sleep :(,0
7422, No  because what is in the past  is the past. The future is what involves you. However  somethings (eg serial murders  or excessive cheating in a partners sense) would be hard to over look. It completely depends on what that person has done and whether I personally can overlook it.,0
7405, I don't really see roses  except for in my garden  and no  I don't because I get paranoid I will snort up a bee ;) lol,0
7404, I do in a way  but it kind of depends on what mood im in. I CANNOT dance sober  thats for sure (not enough confidence to get jiggy :P) and when I am drunk  I tend to go a little hyper and you know how Emily dances in JJ's episode in s3? Well  thats kind of me...a bit...minus the Cook obviously :P,0
7403, I do  but it depends on when and where. If I need to be driving about  then HELL NO! If I Can bum about  then yes :),0
7402, I do yes :) I find it really relaxing! Sometimes if I cant sleep  I get the burner going :),0
7384, ermmm  nah. How much variation can you really have in a hospital? and do they all really have to be white? A splash of colour here and there (not green or blue << BOY COLOURS) would do nicely :),0
7385, I really like it actually :) I think its really soothing. But if im just getting ready to go out  and I just styled my hair  and someone is playing with it. Thats kind of annoying :P lol,0
7386, I do and I don't. I do when Im not working :P When Im working  I HATE THE CHILDREN THAT RUN AROUND YOU AND ASK FOR BALLOONS WHEN YOU ARE BUSY....ahem...,0
7387, Nope. I haven't eaten it in yearssss  so I cant really comment on it at the moment :),0
7388, pants? As in trousers? I do yes  but I don't wear them as much as I do dresses. I wear Leggings ALLLLL the time. Does that count? lol,0
7389, No lol. You mean Dill pickles? The ones they get on sticks? They look wrong  smell like vinegar  and taste....just no :),0
7390, haha! I don't really like pies :P I eat some  depending on its content :) Have a guess!,0
7391, I do in one way  and I don't in another. I loveeeee all the freshly made ones  but as for homemade ones that you put in the oven  my mum ALWAYS ends up burning them  so in that case  not much of a fan. I do like them non black :P,0
7424, I would say it doesn't make a difference really. I prefer blonde hair  looks wise  but I don't think the colour of someones hair makes who they are. Its their personality that I would look for :),0
7392, Plants? Whats not to like? They help us out with the CO2 thing  and all in all  give us natural remedies :) Besides the look rather pretty :D,0
7394, I do indeed! It makes me discover things I didn't even know about myself  especially if its things I wouldn't necessarily think about :),0
7395, I actually don't. I like some types of fish  tuna  cod  salmon  but anything else...nope :),0
7396, I doooooooo :),0
7397, Well it depends who those 'people' were :) I can spend more time with different people. My family for example  not the greatest about of time  but you for example  OF COURSE :D So  a good mix of both works :D,0
7398, What is St Patricks day? lol We don't really celebrate that here  at least I don't think we do :/,0
7399, Stickers? haha! Thats random! I guess...who doesn't like stickers? I like Vinyl ones that you can stick to windows or cars  but thats not really a sticker is it? Thats a vinyl :P,0
7400, WHO DOESNT?! :D,0
7401, I like the individual side of them  only because it makes you think about things you wouldn't normally question. You can discover things you didn't know about yourself. Sometimes scary  sometimes rather informing :),0
7393, By pudding  do you mean desert? :) In which case YES I DOOOOOOOO! I don't really like anything with lemon in though  or oranges really. Im not much of a citrus fan  for some reason  but never have been :),0
7171, Ermmm  well I have loads  but I don't really wear half of them. Say  30 ish?,0
7170, Ummm  I don't know :/ I think a hardcore fan of Gen 2 is a hardcore fan of skins  a fan of the show  isn't hardcore  just a show :),0
7169, Ohh  the SAT we take 3 times. in year 3  6 and 9. They are obviously more important for you guys though  as we take GCSE's at the same time as you take your SAT's.,0
6929, Applebees.<3,0
6930, Uhm. OH. Yeah. I can't tell you. He might read it.,0
6931, ..I don't know..,0
6932, I'd be pissed. I love this pillow. The other pillow is fat and disconfigured ];,0
6933, Who?! xD Gabe?,0
6934, Thanks. (:,0
6935, Awwhhhh. c: Who's thiiiiiiis? <3,0
6936, Not really..xD It's flattering.,0
6937, Yeah  but I like to stick to one guy at a time.,0
6939, Nooo. xD,0
6940, Um..there's nothing I would change  I don't think..,0
6941, o_o El.,0
6942, >_>,0
6944, You  too. (:,0
6945, OH MY GOD. HE DID NOT?!,0

I have loved her for AGES though  WAYYYY before they became famous  so its weird to see their name plastered everywhere :) Same with Little Boots  Lady Gaga and Ellie Goulding. I have loved all those people for so long  way before any of them were so famous. Hold on  they are all female! Hmmm.... ;) lol,0
7157, Charmed  said by Prue?  &quot;Piper: Next time get your own damn lipstick! Prue: I heard that! Piper: I love you! Prue: Bite me!&quot;  (You said nothing about not being able to use Google :P),0
7158, Thank you!!! I don't think I did explode  but I would have if reality hadn't have slept in :( If you die in your dream  thats when they say you actually die in real life isn't it? You are welcome to kick his ass  although I think he is dead now (in my dream  not really lol). So  at least it saves you getting hurt  even if my arms were sliced up with his knife :(,0

7162, HAHAHA! Seriously?! Are you sure it wasn't actually a joint dream??? Haha! Can't believe I just admitted THAT!  Well yeah  I did want to kiss you  and a combination of my dad sat in the front seat and not knowing how you would react (even though I do know now  and I wish I could re enter my dream and correct it ;);)) was a bit of a put off lol (the dad bit  not you obviously :P). So how was the 'not so important things' in your dream?? ;) ;),0
7163, I have no idea lol! All the episodes of charmed kind of bleed into one :P They are all good though  and Charmed  Buffy  Angel  Skins etc etc are like one long TV show  I don't really think of them as individual eps :),0
7164, Haha! My comments would consist of... 1) I don't mind them getting dirtier  it keeps life interesting ;) haha 2) 'One of the many reasons you would be staring at me'? hmmm  and these would be????? ;) 3) I apologise about going insane  but I am better now  so THANK YOU <3 4) I think you should actually visit as soon as actually possible :P I have problems making the first move  but I think you could brake that issue ;) haha! Love the cheese! :P 5) Why am I writing a list??  Haha  anything else you would like to add? Apart from answering these points? :P,0
7165, But it was how many in total right? O_O CONFUSIN' :'(,0
7166, You sent it to me  the only way I answer it is by answering it :P Tough luck :P lol  Its not a legal battle  but more of a difference of opinions. I was trying to meet half way  I think someone is just stubborn and wants his own way ;) lol,0

7944, Favourite smell? My conditioner :),0
7945, Hmmm  how long should we stay? Good question. I reckon we should stay for 2 weeks  then move somewhere hot to relax off? What do you think? :) Well why do we need too bedrooms? ;) haha! Big bed sounds good along with wriggling! HAHA! I can't believing I am posting this on my formspring! HAHA! Ummm  what else  what daily activities would you like to do? :P,0
7946, I would say modern really  just because I love the highly designed things. But I would want it to look 'lived in'  you know? There are a lot of modern designs which are really really empty  which I don't really love. Anyway  I love things that are unusual and colourful  so I suppose it could be a mix of both? :),0
7947, THEY DO RULE! Especially if they are made by vespa  orange  have black pen drawings on them  pom poms coming out of the handles and a pair of bunny ears in the centre ;),0
7948, I do have trouble making the first move but...,0
7949, Ummmm  other than Kathryn Prescott half naked in the intro of episode 2? ;) haha  joking. Probably some traditional things like certain weather changes  animals doing funny things  I don't know lol. Im boring with this answer  but can I go with the sweet answer?  The way of two people falling in love is one of the beautiful things known to man ;) lol,0
7950, Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  I don't think I have one :/  Ummmmmmmmmmmm  ummmmmmmm  ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  perhaps...... Ummmmmmmmm...yeah  don't have one :),0
7951, Ummmm  hmmmm  this means I need to think... I don't think there is anyone as such. There are elements in certain people  and traits that I love over a mixed variety of people.,0
7952, I agree and disagree. People are what we make of them  and some people come across twats and some people kind. It depends on how we get along with them  the factors that stop us from clashing. Often things that you have in common can stop you relating to someone  so all in all  it depends on the person as to whether someone is an ass or not :P,0
7953, WTF? Did he shove some kind of meet on your face???? A dog bit your face? In seriousness? :I,0
7954, WTF?! WHY? Being a typical brother? :(,0
7956, HAHAHAHA! I still class them as a biscuit :) I mean  would you eat a whole packet of cakes? NO! A whole packet of Jaffa biscuits? Yes :),0
7937, I don't eat either. But McDonalds because I don't like the KFC batter.,0
7977, Tie? :/,0
7979, It wasn't you? What wasn't you? lol Okayyy....,0
8001, :( Well I have spoken to you since  and you still didn't finish it  soooooooo how about you just don't go? Then you wouldn't be any worse off now right? :P,0
8002, Has someone been stalking my facebook profile? Who is &quot;me&quot; and I will confirm :P,0
8003, Why not?! I have orders to play about with an old school pentax camera or something too. Sounds good :D,0
8004, Ohh okay  I have heard of Kindergarten  so its like nursery kind of thing  or our 'reception' year...,0
8005, haha thanks. Im going to sort myself out tooooo :) Have fun eating lol.,0
8006, Hmmm  new :) Everything changes so its nice to see what we are heading for and to move on at times :),0
8007, Good good. Glad you have found love. It's rare in this world :P,0
8008, HAHAHAHA! Well I wouldn't say Im THAT bad! Ummm  perhaps 7.5? lol. But then what is 1  and what is 10? lol And you tee-tee?,0
8009, Well  my DVD's were arranged in alphabetical order  but I have changed it to genre to suit the mood Im in. So  I suppose  4? lol,0
8010, 7 x 7 x 7 x 7 = 2401?,0
8011, BREAD!!!!! or pasta... no  bread! lol Mmmmmmm....,0
8012, Okay  here is the scenario. I would slide down slowly under my duvet covers  wrap it around me (creating a shield) but make sure I leave a tiny gap for my eyes to poke through. I would barge through several of the zombies making my way through the door  grab the key from the lock  slam the door the other side  and lock them all in. Then pile up everything I had up to the door. Creating a bollard :),0
8013, haha! He makes cans? Thats random  cool  but random. Couldn't he do that as a day job? Save him from working nights? You know what its like to be hit with a golf club? O_O,0
8014, well you were pretty pink.,0
8015, Haaa! I thought you should be used to it by now ;) *ahem* :P lol,0
8016, Hmmm  well I think Naomi deserves everything that she is getting  especially seeing as she isn't doing anything to win Emily back. She cheated on her  said &quot;I'll do anything&quot; then that was it. There wasn't any making Emily feel special  she was just moping about :S BUT  I think they both need to talk it out now. I think  with Emily  its going too far and they just need to sort it out  even argue it out  but at least get things said and out in the open. They are trying to act as though things are fine  even though both of them know it isn't. I think it is driving them both insane  and perhaps thats why Emily is looking at Mandy  maybe as a way out? I know for sure they are going to sort everything out  but I am disappointed it is going to be so late in the series :(,0
8017, Thank you <333333 I love it :D Butttt  my dad was saying  when I go to Brighton  there isn't really a point in taking my car  because its going to cost me about u00a31000 to have it on the road (not including petrol) and Im not really going to be using it much. So he said about not taking it to Brighton with me  and just using the busses and trains to get about. This bloody sucks  BUT then he had the bloody cheek to say &quot;we might as well sell yours. You aren't going to be using it for nearly a year  I will look into putting it online&quot; WTF DAD!!! YOU ARE NOT SELLING IT! I WANT IT WHEN I COME HOME!!!! :'(,0
8000, If I could  of course! No question it that! :),0
7978, My brain isnt creating the most activity at the moment :P Shouldn't you be going to sleep? Don't you have school tomorrow? :/,0
7999, YAY! :D I try and write as though Im saying it  so its probably why there is so much punctuation LOL!,0
7997, Hmm  about 80 missy :P If this site was actually better  they would have been answered AGES ago but the damn thing kept saying error :'(  Anywayyyy  I stuck through it  because you stuck to it in asking them to me. So THANKS! <33333! LOVE YOUUUUU!,0
7980, Good good good! Love youuuuu <3333,0
7981, haha! Let me guess  beyonce dominates?,0
7982, HAHAHAHA! If someone was missing a nose  and someone else was missing a mouth  what would you notice first? :P,0
7983, Oh  really? Thats random. Okay  then no  we just call it a bread roll. Sorry to disappoint there :(,0
7984, OMFG! All to see whether Jaffa Cakes were a cake and not a biscuit! HAHAHA!,0
7985, It wasn't cleared up :P  It didn't say when you met him ;) the man could also have been traveling to St Ives  wasn't a cleared up question :P,0
7986, What makes you think you will never get her? Explain the situation and I will try and help you out with what to do :),0
7987, You're feeling down? :(,0
7988, I think I have actually posted pretty much everything  except for some things about muffins. But we're not going there :),0
7989, The Day after the beginning of the month?,0
7990, Hi nuisance! How is thee? I thought you looked more like entertainment  but hey ho  welcome anyway :),0
7991, Thats not weirddddddd! Its so sweet how you want to do something that involves helping people :) If thats weird  then im weird :P Am I weird? lol,0
7992, I still don't get it lol!!! Those ancient roman statues  they were made by gay men? huh? Am I being incredibly blonde? :(,0
7993, I noticed :) So have I. Although my evening doesn't sound like it was quite as good as yours :),0
7994, YAY!!!!! Thank you!!! :D LOVE YOUUUUUU <3333,0
7995, I have completely forgotten the previous question (its rather late you know ;);)),0
7996, haha  at least I know where they are coming from then :P Hmm  live anywhere. I suppose I would say somewhere hot  but not too hot  also somewhere great for my careers ambitions  can I be typical and say Los Angeles? :P,0
7998, Sorry? Did that make any sense to anyone other than me? lol,0
7936, Fries :D Im British  im a chip person :P,0
7935, HATE IT!! Isn't it made from Olives or something? Yeah  not a fan of olives  so no marmite thanks :),0
7934, Pina Colada :) Margaritas and daiquiri's are pretty tasteless if im honest :(,0
7874, Its interesting...for about 5 seconds  then I switch the channel :P,0
7875, I cry when I yawn. Its bloody annoying when you have just done your make-up :S,0
7876, I think so yeah  as long as you don't ACT on that crush with multiple people  or tell your other half about the crushes  than you're fine (don't want to make things awkward :S). Well  unless its a celebrity one  because I think everyone has them lol.,0
7877, Yes I think so  definitely! well  yourself for one thing :P Don't even go there by saying you arent! If you saw yourself in a bar  you would SO chat yourself up  don't even deny it :P,0
7878, No  why is it wrong? The only problem  is that its French :P JOKE!,0
7879, no lol. Thats like saying is it wrong to like tea :/,0
7880, Of course.,0
7881, I would like to think so yes :),0
7882, Yes. I think so yes  in different ways too. If someone gets you  why can't you return the favour? I think revenge  can show people something too  if that makes sense? Shows you how something feels. Take Naomily for example  Emily kissing that girl  it showed Naomi (in a really small sense) how Emily is feeling  even though it doesn't compare  Emily blatantly did it on purpose to get back at her  and I would probably do the same in her position. So  yes  I think it can be :),0
7883, &quot;Rosie? Are you asleep?&quot; &quot;yes...&quot; Yeah she is sorry...,0
7884, Half full. Why be negative about it :),0
7885, Ummm  I think the term 'perfect relationship' varies for everyone and anyone depending on their mood at the time. You know? If I were to answer this  I would say someone who loved me for who I was  and vice versa. Someone who gets you  who unterstands your feelings and needs  and treats you with the respect you treat them with. Someone romantic  cute  witty  honest  trusting etc lol. how about you?,0
7886, Not that im aware of.,0
7887, BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Hey lester buddy ;),0
7888, It is naturally quite wavy yes :) It goes REALLY curly if it gets wet when im out or something  and I hate it when It gets rained on  because I can't sort it out until I am back home :( Anyway  normally I don't really do much to my hair. I always blow dry it  kind of so it goes a messy wavy kind of look. I don't use any straightners or curlers on it (very often anyway) I just let it do its thannnnng :) Probably why it is in such good condition then :) I style it occasionally obviously  but more often than not  its left messy :) But like styled messy  not like  trampy or anything LOL!,0
7889, It is actually :) I remember when I went to the hairdressers to actually ask about bleaching my hair  and they said &quot;but your hair is so soft and shiny! Don't ruin it!&quot; But its better than doing it when its weak and it falling out lol! So yeah  it is pretty glossy :),0
7890, Its actually not  because then my hand would look scary ;),0
7873, Onlt a tad ;) haha <3,0
7891, Carla's middle name will always be cool to you because its personal. Mine  is cool to anyone else who is named Annabel :P,0
7872, Totally not! Only if you have a crush on his on screen daughters  then yes. Fuck it   John Bishop is totally hot! Not to me  obviously  but in general XD,0
7870, YES! Definitely! I think family is very much  what you can make of it  but still. They are the people that have lived to bring you up  you need to respect and be thankful for that  even if I don't get along with them all the time.,0
7853, I Would LOVE to join you :) Well thanks! Can I spend all my money on nice clothes and take you to dinner? :P haha,0
7854, Awwwwww  I missed you too (didn't want to be soppy and admit it though  but I clearly failed ;)) Pretty boring day  but there again  you weren't here  so what do I expect? :P Anything fun happen at school? :),0
7855, Ohhhhhh  did you just tweet me saying Hi? See  its all coming together! :D Who doesnt love Skins right?! XD,0
7856, Awwww. Well it got you to admit your name ;) I feel there was a win on my part :P Im sorry :( *seals cuts with superglue*,0
7857, haha! Go for it! :D You will thank me later :),0
7858, Can I call the local butchers? They are bound to have some utensils that come in handy in case im attacked ;) haha,0
7859, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA! I just loled!!! Is that serious?! HOW AWFUL!!! I take it its an arranged marriage or something random? HAHA! POOR BLOKE TOO!  Thats worse than dying a virgin LOL,0
7860, I think they can be fun BUT the only worry I have about them  is some people don't wear the right gear and I get a bit concerned about that. Especially if its people that I really care about or love :( I do think they are pretty fun though  and my sister did have a moped before she learned to drive a car. She gave it up about 2 weeks into passing her test lol! So apart from being concerned  they are rather cool :D,0
7861, Ohhhhh  I get it! Well  Kathryn thats a rather trick question isn't it :P Because its both :P Katie  and Kat :),0
7862, Depends on where I am. In my bedroom  like 2  in the woods  about 9 :),0
7863, Ummm  probably kind of the same as the last answer  in a weird way. Sensitivity? Only because  being a girl and someone doing something for you  either a friend  family member or a lover  you appreciate it so much more. Also  being a girl (this is going to sound terrible) but you are able to handle things better  and are able to understand how a certain person is feeling or thinking  and you can react to it in the right way. If that makes sense? Men  again some  not all  are less sensitive  and don't understand why that person is crying or angry  but being a girl. You just know :),0
7864, Well apart from the obvious  having children  the pain of giving birth  periods  etc etc. Sensitivity I think. Just because  I know im a very sensitive person  and I really hate how I let things upset me sometimes. A lot of men  not all  but the majority  don't let things bother them so much as women do. So definitely that :(,0
7865, Well I am independent in the sense that I don't care what other people think (about certain things anyway) and I don't let anything else influence what I wear or say.  A lot of people say my dress sense is &quot;unique&quot; and I would agree lol. I still live at home  only because I have no other choice. Im only 20  and you will see what its like to be still pretty young and not have the biggest income. If I moved out  I would be paying rent for somewhere  but I couldn't even afford to live. So whats the point in moving out? I will in time  well in september. So its going to be a nice break :) When I am at home  im independent in the sense that I like to be in my bedroom or by myself doing things (not that Im a loner lol) I just find it easier to concentrate on something if no one else is there. You know what I mean? I sound completely weird don't I??? O_O lol!,0
7866, Inny,0
7867, Inny :) You?,0
7868, Well  what is perfect? I suppose that determines our answer :) There isn't such a thing  its different to the individual. But I suppose  no :(,0
7869, Never. Curiosity keeps you alive :) It keeps things entertaining...,0
7871, Forever will never be over...,0
7892, 'Many tics'...explains the story behind 'the parliment' then ;) lol,0
7893, Does this face look like it cares? To me  this face looks like it's smiling...,0
7894, Appreciate the world. To change something is a HECK of a big deal  and its not always achievable  which means you would never be satisfied. So  to appreciate it the way it is  means you would always get something out of it :),0
7917, My cat...,0
7918, &quot;The lights going out&quot;,0
7919, Ummm  I have too many to think about :S I watched St Trinians the other day. Thats definitely up there on worst movie list :( Also Mr and Mrs Smith  damn boring :(,0
7920, Jacket DEFINITELY! More movement. Besides  if you split your jacket  you just take it off...can't say the same for your pants (trousers) now can we ;) lol,0
7921, I guess thats the rule of life :) We live once  may as well enjoy it right?,0
7922, Hmmmmm  thats difficult. Im attracted to Kat more (there is something that draws me in) but I think I could get on with Lily better. So  hard to say. Can I be greedy and say both? :P,0
7923, Ummm  how about New Jersey? ;) Sounds good to me :P,0
7924, WOOOP FOR NAOMILY! <333 They need to fix them  because at the moment  Skins are going the WRONG way about it :S Perhaps we see all the angst (again) and at the end they get a happy ending (again). I would rather they end happy than start happy and break up. You? :),0
7925, You mean on me or someone else? Long for both anyway lol,0
7926, I cant pick. I ship you with them both ;),0
7927, Love you. &quot;SHARE THE LOVEEEEEE!!! You feeling it?&quot;,0
7928, HAHA! I don't actually. Im not one for pickup lines  they are just so unoriginal you know? If someone was actually trying to ask me out or whatever  I would rather they put in a bit of effort rather than reading something from a book. BUT  the cheesy ones are incredibly funny. No good to actually get a date  but still funny :P I would rather talk to someone and get to know the real them  probably why I am still single :(,0
7929, Love you toooo <333 :),0
7930, Oh yeah? Im liking that plan! I loved those looks the best too! They are my speciality!!!! I think you should get your butt over here with an empty suitcase ;) It would be leaving VERY full  and no  not just because im hiding in it too :P haha,0
7931, Ummm  really happy? I can't remember :( A little while ago I think. I haven't been too happy these last months. Really excited? Probably about moving down to brighton in september and getting my own place etc :) Really angry? Well  the thing I explained to you earlier. Where I was putting my Skins magazines on ebay  and my sister came in  sat on my bed and started chatting. I turned back to my computer and my sister went really quiet  so I turned to look at her  and she was happily trying to rub off Kat's signature off of my DIVA magazine. Yeah  I wasn't too happy! Luckily she didn't but thats not the point :( She is 23 too  so should have known hell better :S Really sad? Well unfortunately  I have been pretty sad for quite a while  and I cant seem to look up about things. Does that answer it? :),0
7932, Oh  it sounds like you have a longer education system than we do  but I think we just change schools more  I don't know lol,0
7933, if there were 2 of us that had trouble making a move  then I think that creates ONE HELL of a lot of sexual tension lol! As soon as one person then does make a move (because its just an amount of time before someone actually breaks) it would be really really intense :D,0
7916, :O I haven't seen a lady bird in AGES!!!!!! They are a sign of spring and summer  so go youuuuu! Isn't it the black ones that pee? I hope for your sake they aren't peeing everywhere :P haha!,0
7915, LACE! Im not a big fan of leather  unless its a jacket  then I would say a big no no to a lace jacket :P,0
7914, It depends on what it is. Bedding or anything  then cotton lol. Clothing or underwear  then lace :P,0
7913, Who's there?,0
7895, Happy Birthday mystery persons dad :) Ermm  45?,0
7896, ITALIAN! Thats my favourite kind of food :D,0
7897, Ohhhh. I don't know either  I just googled it :P lol,0
7898, Ohhhhh yeah! I forgot that! Oh bollocks! That means work is going to be busy :'(,0
7899, It must have been good  but we lost it somehow :'(,0
7900, I feel very special to have been tainting your dreams :D Even if it did end up with you being in pain :( Im glad I could have helped <3,0
7901, Like wise ;);),0
7902, Missed his middle name :(,0
8018, BEACH!!!!!!! 100%!!!!!! :D,0
7903, Jesus H Christ.,0
7905, Awww thank you :) and when we say special  I take it we don't mean 'weird' or anything o_O lol,0
7906, OMFG! Did you actually just do that?! HAHAHAHA! If I fell in my cats litter tray  I would scream uncontrollably until the litter shakes itself off of my body :S,0
7907, Hmmm  well Im am getting baked cookies  soooo  second best option  would be cheeeeeeesecake! A strawberry cheesecake <333333 :D,0
7908, I love you more than cheese!!,0
7909, It worksssssss XD,0
7910, HAHA!!! Sorry  busy couple of days  I haven't been on here :( Anywhooo  im here now! How did you work me out Louise? You hit the nail on the head there! Too much missage!!! <3,0
7911, I don't know who has posted this  so  as a result  thank you for the offer  but I shall have to decline :) Unless you are that person that is allowed kisses  then of course ;),0
7912, I would  you know that ;) I don't think you even need the question mark  you do not have to ask :P,0
7904, haha. I dont know if that wink is a good idea :P,0
8019, Yeah  it was actually. The underlying story  which didn't pan out in quite the happy ending I gave it in the fic lol  unfortunately. But hey  we learn from it yeah :D,0
8020, Ohhh I see! Okay for one  when people walk into my room  and say I have my main light off and side lamps on (so its dimmer) and they walk in  turn the light on  speak  then walk out  leaving the lights on  and door wide open.  It DOES MY HEAD IN!!!! lol I know its only small  but if you are doing something at a desk or something  then to keep getting up to shut the door and turn the light off <<< ANNOYING :S,0
8021, Ohhh I see. Nice :),0
8129, HAHA! Push up bra! lol! Im not a fan of thongs :/ Obviously for some occasions  but not overly keen :P,0
8130, To be...definitely. Sounds better :),0
8131, Okay  here is my toast routine  and it has to be precise :) When the toast pops up  it has to be buttered STRAIGHT away  so that the butter melts and then you eat while still warm :) So the answer (after the essay about toast)  butter :),0
8132, GIRLY-GIRLS! Definitely :D I don't really understand lesbians that fancy girls that look like boys. I have no problem with it  obviously  I just personally don't get it. I like girls  so I like girls that look like girls lol. :),0
8133, Hmmm  some people already know the answer to that. You know who you are ;),0
8134, It would totally shut him up :),0
8135, Its the development of the modern age. The kids all have better things to do. Doing things rather than tweeting about them. Looks like we need to be catching up.,0
8136, TWITTER FAILLLLLLLL :( Justin's fault :(,0
8137, Oh buggar! Not a clue where thats from :/,0
8138, V-Card? You mean valentines card? Did I get one?  I think you created more questions then lol. If thats what you meant  then yeah I got one lol.,0
8139, No probs :),0
8140, Virgin card? What the hell is that?! LOL!,0
8141, I hope there were no children around then? They would have picked up some baddd words. Thats all on you missy ;) haha,0
8142, yes please :) I want to get some fresh air  but its dark and scary outside  so not by myself :(,0
8143, Hmmm  okay drink  remote control and a jumper (if its cold :)),0
8144, Well at least they are keeping the floors nice and clean... Am I the only one that secretly REALLY wants them to hit the stone thing by accident  and send it back the other way? That would be some good ass entertainment :D,0
8145, Sorrrry :( It's not because of you though missy :P That actually makes it better :) You are welcome to hate mine? :),0
8128, Isn't that from a Family Guy episode?,0
8146, I don't like that song.,0
8127, Ummm  I would say perhaps green?  Because im quite a cheerful person  but sometimes I can be pushed  and I may become down about something becoming 'blue' ;)  OR  on the other hand  im easily cheered up about something  becoming a happy yellow! I have no idea lol  im just thinking logically :P,0
8125, This is a difficult question. Even if there wasn't a year of my life in the balance  I don't know if I would. When you lose the people that you love  its so so painful  and to get them back  even for a moment  you know you are going to go through all that pain again. Is it worth it? So no  I probably wouldn't :(,0
8108, Awwwwwwww! You are SO Sweet! Don't you ever change! EVER! EVERRRRRRR! You are nothing but amazing  and I really do love you too! <333,0
8109, Pasta with roasted peppers  cream cheese and steamed Salmon with cracked black pepper :),0
8110, Haha  well it can be remembered for later use :),0
8111, haha! Thanks :) I do need to be taken care of at times  of course. But what can I say? Smaller people are too darn cute! lol,0
8112, Be bold. Can you see the questions im being asked?! LOL!,0
8113, Hmmmm  the Kathryn one? How about you expand for me considering I didn't really get it :P,0
8114, Yeah  its not a let down so much  but it doesnt seem to go anywhere. It doesnt grow. It kind of feels like they chopped the 1st one in half  added more video and stuck it back together again. There was no growth or development :(,0
8115, I was actually going to go to bed  but now you are home  Im not :P I missed you too :( Hmmm  I need to find out who this was from then....hmmmm.....,0
8116, Is it embarrassing if I said 'Tik Tok' by Ke$ha. O_O,0
8117, OMG! Was he a virgin?! Poooooooooor guy!!! I mean  at 84  he really didn't have much of a chance did he? It probably wouldn't work at that age. Blessssss him! That sucks :(,0
8118, Well  personally  I kind of thing you need to know if the person at least things of you that way a little. Have you tried reading little signs and stuff that they give you? Got anything from that?,0
8119, Ohhhh  well thats a faillll because I don't have a multiregional player :( I might watch it online or something  Thanks :D,0
8120, At least its always surprising us :),0
8121, hahahaha! Did you just google it to test me? You tested me! Coooooool :P,0
8122, haha! Well they are pretty good to me :D You always ask really good questions  this is obviously why. You plan and are potentially really organised :P,0
8123, Hmmmmmm. Are you ready for a relationship with someone else? Because I know dating someone doesn't sound like the best way to get over someone else  but sometimes it really can help :) x,0
8124, Hahaha! I just noticed that you copied this in one of my questions! HA! Thats hilarious! :P I shall use my imagination then  just like the doctor ordered ;) There was fluff and smut? SCORRRRRRE ;);) haha!,0
8126, Work today! :( A group of 5 guests walked out without paying their bill  and I wasn't around at that precise moment to stop them  so they left  getting off scott free. I spoke to my manager  and he said that  &quot;they are my responsibility so I need to pay the bill with my own money&quot;. The bill was u00a380  and they were having a laugh if they thought I was paying that with my own cash! I can't keep an eye on my tables 100% of the time  because 99% of the time  I am doing things for them  which do involve walking to other areas of the restaurant. So anyway  this sparked a huge argument between me and my manager  and I wasn't backing down  and giving in resulting in myself being out of pocket. It was out of my control  and the company generates so much money  so why should they use their staff to continue generating profits? Well  I was SO SO SO angry  and I eventually went to the staff toilets to have a little cry due to the frustration of the situation.  It was sorted in the end  and because I didn't back down and agree to give it to them  they let it go lol. Like they should have too!,0
8147, Because of the job that I do  I am constantly meeting and engaging with new people. Some of them are nice  some of them...not. Some weird  some eccentric  some rude  some polite. Its hard to put a definition on 'weirdest' and to pin a certain person down. Definitely some of the customers I meet are very weird (if I take it as the 'odd' interpretation)  for example  once I had 2 guys sat down in one of my tables  and one kept staring at me. It was a little offputting  so I tried to avoid them as much as I could. When I was putting their food down  a member of staff (a guy) said bye to me  gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. The guy on my table  stood up  eyed him with the worst look as my friend walked out. He then looked at me and said &quot;he doesn't appreciate your eyes. He looks about 12  pshhhhh&quot;  then sat down and ate. LOL!!! Thats just one weirdo  I meet a lot :P,0
8148, Hmmmmm  well  thats quiet a lot :) I agree  thats love ;) <33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333 x infinity ;),0
8149, YEAH! That part on After Ellen was hilarious! Kat was like &quot;well their is a hap-!&quot; and lily makes a strange &quot;Bzz&quot; ing noise or something! That was too cute for words! lol! So yeah  its probably about showing Naomi how much she really cares (again). But hey  I love jealous Naomi! Only because I think Emily needs to see it. So yeah  sounds good for the ending XD I hope they don't do anything like they did last series though (Gen1 I mean) no one really had happy endings :S It was sad :''''''(,0
8172, Live XXL Hair colour in &quot;Red Passion&quot; :) Although  I used a garnier nutrisse browny colour as a base.,0
8173, Ummmm  blonde  brown  red  purple and pink :) Soon going back to blonde (bleach) but still a natural-ish colour :),0
8174, A cob? As in sweetcorn? LOL!,0
8175, Mallerinas?,0
8176, It depends  you have to ask yourself; is there a chance we could ever be something? If the answer is yes  then thats a good start. You need to get to know that person and then go from there.  If the answer is &quot;not a chance!&quot; then  its really shit  but you need to stop yourself from falling any harder than you already have. I know its hard to do  and its much easier for someone else to say &quot;get over them&quot; because its a fucking hard thing to do! To get over someone  especially when you have fallen hard  it really hurts  but you need to catch it before it ends up getting worse. You know? If you know there definitely isn't a chance between you  and you know that you are ready for a relationship  its probably best to find someone else and concentrate your feelings on them instead. If you are willing to let your feelings (for the other person go)  involving yourself with someone can let them melt away. Anyway  its never easy  and to persue them can be an easier way out  but it all depends on how strong you are  and the person you have fallen for. Okay  essay answer. Good luck :),0
8177, It depends on what it is  if its something that involves or affects you  then you call them out on it. If its something that is personal to them  then let them come to you in their own time. Either way  give them time to come to you about it  and then resort to the above option after you've given them a chance to explain. I don't know if that really helps?,0
8178, Well it pretty much sucks to be honest. Its happened to me before  and its really hard to deal with. I think rather than giving up  make sure there is no chance with them. If there is  then go for it! You have nothing to lose. If there isn't a chance I think then you need to try and think about all the negative things about that person  to try and snap yourself out of it  at least until some of the pains wears off :(,0
8179, Whenever something important is out of my control. Like  if something has happened in work  and im going to be in trouble for example ;) Or an interview  because you have no control over the situation (apart from how you come across) it can be bloody scary! :(,0
8180, I normally drink water  and eat....I guess revels? If I eat anything  its maltesers or Revels :),0
8181, Individual? :),0
8182, Probably both  depending on my mood :),0
8183, Well  obviously im gay  so I can't comment about things on guys  but girls. I love how feminine they can be (not in a Paris or Nicole way  GOD NO) but how a girl can be all &quot;does my bum look big in this?&quot; or &quot;what colour dress?&quot;  its just rather cute  lol. Also  girls are pretty hot. What can I say ;) and AGAIN  the sensitivity thing. A girl can get you more than a guy can  so I think to understand your partner in a relationship  is pretty damn important :),0
8184, I look for someone who is similar to me actually. I would say that someone trusting  honest  caring  funny  cute  romantic are all qualities that I look for in someone who I would potentially date :),0
8185, Their ability to constantly be at eachothers throats. Wow. Don't you just love it :P,0
8186, Hmmmm  probably stroking my Skin <333 Both are so relaxing though :),0
8187, The majority of them are probably cool beans  however  there is an odd few that  well  what can I say. Let the standards of the UK slip ;),0
8188, Seeing as this question was about Puberty and not poverty  there really isn't very many issues I feel about it. Except that fact  that its obviously good  otherwise there would be young men wandering around with incredibly hight pitched voices. That would be confusing.,0
8171, A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!! :D I think the premature menopause thing was a bit random  I would have liked it to have been something else (she just seems too young for that) but on a good note. I loved the Naomily angst  and Im glad Emily is going all &quot;off the rails&quot; let Naomi know exactly what she has done to her :S Plussss  the Fitches. A whole 45 minute episode around the Fitches. Can't complain at that XD What did you think?,0
8170, Same  Caude Michel &quot;Colour Protect&quot;. Smells lovely!,0
8169, Pink.,0
8168, Ummm  I don't know if its possible  but I believe that someone could have STRONG feelings for someone at first sight. For me  falling in love means falling in love with their personality too  and you can't know their personality by just looking at them. So for me  not possible :P,0
8150, Haha! Well technically we are already married  so seeing as you are my newly wed  I had to choose you ;) How about you? Snog  Marry  Avoid? :),0
8151, Awwww &quot;A very cute idiot&quot; I have never awwed at being called an idiot before :P <3,0
8152, No  I was just named Kelly because my dad liked it. They put a lot of thought into that one didn't then :P But imagine if I was named my mums old surname (which would have been changed to blake once she got married) and then they split up  going back to her former surname. What a shit name! lol,0
8153, I don't really believe in anything in particular. Im more a mix of views and stuff rather than sticking to any religion exactly.  I was baptised  so technically I am a christian  but im not in the sense that I don't believe in God. Well  I don't not believe  but I don't believe exactly either lol. Im an Athiest I suppose :) How about you? :),0
8154, Poverty frankly sucks. Don't get me started on this :S Why are places like Africa still in so much debt  when all they do is borrow money from other countries = to pay back other debts  therefore getting themselves worse in the process. Where is good will these days? Why cant 3rd world debt be abolished? As for poverty in other situations. Some people who are lazy and can't be bothered to give a shit  I don't feel for. But the people who are trying to get by  but cant because of tax and loans and owing people shit  what's the point? We are all people  cant we live the same? too many issues for a single post :),0
8155, Errrrrm  im going to be obvious and say Ellie? lol,0
8156, Buffy  Angel  Charmed  The OC  South of Nowhere  Friends. Mostly the high school ones  probably because I can relate to them better :),0
8157, HAHA! Animal? Ummm  I don't think I really resemble any animals lol. Well the closest would probably be an ape  but thats only because of evolutional purposes  Im not big and hairy! :P lol,0
8107, VODKA!!! But put it in the freezer before hand  and it takes away the TWANNNG :),0
8158, Ummm  I have never been that crazy really. Well  I can't remember  and that may be a good thing lol! I wasn't a boring teenager  but I was never  lets say like Cook (and I know you watch Skins ;) lol). Im not the person to say &quot;don't do this  don't do that&quot;  I do like to try things  but I suppose I have never been &quot;CRAZY-esque&quot; :),0
8160, I had spaghetti bolognaise with a meat substitute. How yummy :),0
8161, Right now  a night in without the parents. How exciting (that was sarcasm by the way) :),0
8162, Hmmm  can I name cocktails? Rasbaretto (Rasberry liqueur  ameretto and vanilla ice cream) Barnamint Baileys (Baileys  mint liqueur  oreo cookies  vanilla ice-cream) June Bug (Midori  Malibu  sweet and sour  pineapple juice),0
8163, Im addicted to music  without doubt! and probably twitter and formspring (which is really bad! Your fault :P haha),0
8164, Well  my mum is kind of an easy going person BUT she can be REALLY annoying! She always jumps to things  for example &quot;Kelly  feed the animals&quot; &quot;Okay  give me 10 minutes then I will do it&quot; &quot;Okay  but you better  they will die with no food. Rabbits need to be fed every day otherwise they need to go to the vets&quot; &quot;yes  okay mum&quot; &quot;I mean it Kelly. Tonight&quot; &quot;yeah mum! I know&quot; &quot;they will die otherwise&quot; *I ignore* lol  My dad  well he is the opposite really. Things he wants  he gets. He want's something done a certain way  thats how its done. He is pretty argumentative too  which is probably why we clash. I stick up for things that I believe in  so we don't get on like the best of people :( How about yours? :),0
8165, Well I say sweetie  hun  lovely quite a bit. I don't really say babe  not even in the romantic kind of way  its not the nicest of things to be called lol. If I find someone attractive then I call them gorgeous  or beautiful or something :) If I were dating someone  I would probably call them gorgeous a lot lol. I call Bella gorgeous all the time! Because she is just tooooo beautiful for words :D,0
8166, ITS COLDDDDDDD :'(,0
8167, Well  in 5 years  I would like to see myself having successfully completed the motion picture film course in Brighton  and hopefully I would have made some useful contacts within the filming industry. I would hopefully be starting out in smaller projects (perhaps even as a runner) and by 5 years  would like to see myself having created some successful short films to take to international short film festivals. In 10 years  I would like to see myself having started out in direction or production of small independent films  and starting to settle down with a family :),0
8159, Never Cheat. Never lose hope. Never give in.,0
7852, Haha! I love that you paint your nails so often! You are the only person that I know who regularly keeps them updated :) My nails are painted now? Of course they are! I can't remember a day when I went out without painted nails :P They are a dark red colour :) They usually are to be honest :),0
8106, Oh temple massage! Definitely! That is just <333333! Because then it leads to cuddling too :),0
8104, Ermmmm  waking up next to a bloke after taking E and thinking &quot;SHIIIIIIT!&quot;. *whistles and walks out quietly* :S,0
8043, Cuddles :) Im not one of those people that needs sex to survive  im not saying no to it mind lol. Im just more of a cuddle person :),0
8044, I actually forgot to send you that pasta. I ate it instead. Perhaps we call it quits?,0
8045, It means nothing? Why not? I dont even know the definition of shed talk  define :),0
8046, To be honest  I know why they are all from anyway  so no need to worry ;),0
8047, Depends in which country you live in. But yeah  probably :P,0
8048, Depends where your bedroom is?,0
8049, Does that even make sense?,0
8050, It depends on your situation? What is the situation  explain it to me :),0
8051, No  I hear they feed you rabbits.,0
8052, Go for it! Comes in handy yeah? Every need space awareness? You got it right there :P,0
8053, wouldn't that be giving in too early?,0
8054, HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I think it might be worthwhile  but by doing that  they highlight it to all the innocent Kids  then they will all want one lol. I didn't even notice  at least I was an innocent one ;),0
8055, I think its important yes  BUT it is also important to have a close friend outside the relationship. Just because if anything ever happened and you went through a 'rough patch'  sometimes other people can make you see things clearer. So  I think they can  but to have someone else outside the relationship is even more important.,0
8056, Hmmm  tricky. Thats the same thing. I suppose all in all  they should shut it yeah? :P,0
8057, Awwwwww! Thats SO cute! Well I just watched it myself  and everytime there was an advert break  I kept thinking about coming back online to talk to you  but then Skins was back and I didn't. Haha  I did though. Like I promised <3 I think you REALLY should get that plane :) Just saying ;) <333,0
8058, Probably neither lol. Not a fan of heights :S,0
8060, Laughing :) Smiling can be faked  and that can sometimes be unhappy. So Laughing. Thats never fake :),0
8042, yes  definitely screwed :P,0
8061, Snog Emily and Lily  send off Naomi and Kat (SOrrrrrry Kat! I still love you  but you know  Emily and Lily more <3333) lol,0
8041, SWEDEN!!!!! No doubt!,0
8039, Rock  definitely.,0
8022, If its cold  then I would say blankets  but ultimately a pillow  only because we all need that bit of neck comfort. The neck is where it matters  lol.,0
8023, Ermmmmm  that I haven't visited already? Well I would like to go back to London  because London is pretty huge and I haven't been everywhere there. Ermmm  everywhere really :) I would like to visit a lot of my twitter dudes  to see how they are all getting along :) But certain special people *cough cough* don't live in the UK :'(,0
8024, Pool :) Is it lame that I go all OCD with an Ocean getting paranoid that a crab will bite my toes? lol Also  I was swimming in the sea in Florida  and kept feeling all of these things hitting my skin. Then  out of no where  these little white fish were flying out of the water an up into the air! At first  we were all like &quot;WTF! KEEP YOUR MOUTHS SHUT!&quot; and one hit my shoulder. My sister and Dad then got stung by a jellyfish so thats probably why they were darting for it :P,0
8025, Ummmm  huh? Wedding or surgery? You really have some odd fetish for being a doctor ;) <3 A wedding :),0
8026, Pretty woman  the kind I like to meet.,0
8027, Protein :) Fiber just means you get rid of it LOL,0
8028, I am indeedo :) Out and proud! :D,0
8029, Rabbits (they are safer) :P,0
8030, Wet and shit lol. Unless its a romantic movie scene  then its cute <333 :D,0
8031, A bit of all of them really. Some are GROSSSSSSS! Some are SO OBVIOUSLY made up  and some are freaking hilarious that even the queen would chuckle at them :),0
8032, hahahahahaha! Smut lover eugh? ;),0
8033, Real-life fantasy :) Only because its more relatable I suppose. Im not a massive fan of lord of the rings though  but I LOVE Charmed  angel  buffy etc :),0
8034, Black Dress. Red Dresses clash with my hair a little too  but still  when I go back blonde  I love blonde hair with black clothing  I think it looks LUSHHHHHHH! :D,0
8035, Red definitely  Bright red  full of colour XD,0
8036, I haven't really thought about them being different. I know one is land one is water  but I haven't thought much about which I prefer. I like frogs  so Amphibians :),0
8037, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh dear lord!!!!! Well I guess you will have to wait and see ;);) In seriousness  I don't really know to be honest. Been a while since anyone has been able to let me know :),0
8038, Rock,0
8040, Indeed. I dont play games...,0
8062, lol! Only when you have school....yeah? ;),0
8063, In september actually :D Im REALLY excited  but im also really nervous about the anticipation of it  you know? Im going to be down there by myself  and living without my parents would be AMAZING!  Still scary though :S Mixed minds about it :D,0
8064, Mum  definitely :) although  I know she doesn't agree with me being Gay  but I still get on with her better than I do my dad. I argue with my father ALL the time  about any little thing! Its just  terrible! We just don't gel all that well...,0
8087, Occasionally  but not at the moment :),0
8088, Hmm  stripes?,0
8089, Sun  its warmer <333333,0
8090, Sun :),0
8091, Good :D,0
8092, Sunset  it means its closer to bedtime lol! Sunrise is tooooo early :( Also  sunset  when its warm  romanticccccc :) How about you?,0
8093, HAHA! &quot;Bummm&quot;? You mean fit? LOL! Not my cup of tea darlin' ;) She is pretty though! Oh  and Im will you on the tall thing! GO TAYLOR BECAUSE YOU'RE TALL!! :D,0
8094, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! Well  they may say something along those lines :P I haven't used a camera in a WHILLLE so bare with me. Also  I only have a crappy mini DV camera :S I want to get a HD Camcorder  but don't have the cash atm :(,0
8095, shy-reserved-short and cute :) DEFINITELY! Everyone knows im not into that typical 'hot' kind of stereotype look. Being cute does it for me so much more :),0
8096, Pale  definitely. Its more natural. I don't mean  like scary white  but it completely depends on their natural skin tone. If someone is naturally olive skinned  then darker  but if they are naturally lighter  they don't need to be tanned to be beautiful :),0
8097, Hmm  thats a hard one. It depends on where the tattoo or piercing is. I LOVE tongue lip (centre stud) piercings  and any in your ear  as for tattoos. As long as its nothing too cheap looking  or nothing too big  or on your face or something :S So yeah  piercings :) I CAN NOT STAND eyebrow piercings though. Thats probably the worst for me (besides weird cheek studs or something :S),0
8098, Love you toooooo :D,0
8099, Tea. With half a bucket of milk :),0
8100, Indeedio ;) Just like my fanfiction :),0
8101, I was once pushed down concrete steps by my sister  and my scull was cracked open. I had to go to hospital to get it stapled back together :S Im sure I cried at the time  I can't remember it  but I have been told :/ There was blood everywhere too  so its not too lame to cry :P,0
8102, If I tell you over this  then everyone will know :(,0
8103, Oh god! Okay  ready for an essay from me this time? :P  So  I was born. Which I don't remember  otherwise that would have been a sight! I open my eyes  to see and hear &quot;pushhhhhhhhh&quot; and a little slit with light coming through-ahem! I shall start a little later :P  I went to primary school  and all through the 6 years  I was such a good girl  and I was even encouraged by a teacher to do something wrong because I saw so innocent.  I got bullied pretty badly through the years 4-6 and eventually I started to stick up for myself towards the end  so they dropped it and left me alone. I won :D Anyway  In year 6 I had my first (and little did I know  last) crush on a boy. I told my mum  and she got really excited that i was 'growing up'. Well  this crush was really big (or at least I thought it was at the time) and I Remember at our end of year prom thing  he asked me out. I got really embarrassed and I ended up saying no (which I kicked myself for in the end). I started secondary school  and my parents wanted me to go to the school that my sister goes to. It is SUCH a good school  but I refused because all my friends were going to my local one  and I wanted to go with them. Well I started school fine  and got along really well with everyone. About a year later  the people who I went to school with  aka my friends from primary school  started to pick on me. It got really bad again  and I ended up having no one.  I met another friend  Laura and she helped me through everything. Eventually we became best friends  and the other group of friends now started to pick on her because she was friends with me. One day  I thought enough is enough  and I went to a teacher about the bullying. She phoned up both of our parents  and let them know what was happening. About a week later  once things had started to calm down a little  the girl who bullied me  her mum phoned up the school  saying that I was now bullying her! I was called into a meeting with the bully herself and another teacher to sort this out. This teacher was crap  and basically believed everything the other girl was saying  just because she was coming off &quot;sweet and innocent&quot;. My mum heard about this  and called up the bullys mum to have a chat with her. She came around our house  and was trying to pick a fight with my mum outside  all while I was listening to them argue while hiding under the stairs. She left  and my mum refused to engage in a fight over something that could be sorted without parental violence. Nothing was ever sorted  and I think the girl (the bully) got a little scared about being found out and her mums temper  that she finally left me alone. So  I was happy again :)  I finished secondary school pretty happy. I was top of most of my classes  and i even was entered into this british art competition by my art teacher  which I won :D I loved art at school  and every lunch and after school  my art teacher let us have her room so I could sit and carry on with my work. Because I loved it so much! she wouldn't let anyone else in their  except for me and my friends  because I was her no1 student :) Well  life was good until I started to become confused about my sexuality. I didn't think much about it at first  only that all my friends were talking about 'boys' and I couldn't agree or relate to anything that they were saying.  Well  I finished school really confused  and went onto college to study further subjects. I grew apart from my old friends  because being in a different college  with a different time table  its awkward to keep in touch so well as you were before. So I made a new circle of friends  and I got really close to one girl in particular. We became best friends  and told eachother everything. About 2 years after being friends  I decided I wanted to tell someone about me being gay  and thought she was the best person to tell. So  I told her  and almost instantly  she abandoned me :( We didn't really speak anymore  and I know it was because I freaked her out  and she didnt want to have a 'lesbian' as her best friend :(  So  I moved on and decided I didn't want to have a friend like her if something as small as sexuality would ruin our relationship. So anyway  I started my art foundation year  and I FUCKING LOVED IT!!! It was one of the best times of my life  and Idid love the end parts in particular. I went through that phase  of not being bothered to go  and I did take a bit of time off (usually to sleep on at home lol)  but I still came out with one of the best grades out of a couple of hundred people. So I was really proud :D  Anyway  once finishing that year  I didn't know what I wanted to continue on to university  so I decided to take a gap year  and build up a little money and sort my head out with what I actually wanted to do. in the year I was working for my parents a bit  property developing and stuff. The year turned into 2  and I kind of went astray from any dreams that I really wanted. Which is why I did something about it  got my ass in gear and applied to Brighton Film School. Well  I got in  as you know  and that pretty much leads me up to now :)  Soooo  I AM SO SORRY about this essay :P I hope you haven't fallen asleep  and I sincerely appologise if you have :( So  in response to yours  you don't have to apologise about it being long! and it wasn't boring  its interesting to hear everything that has gone on with your life. I would consider you as a friend too  so that means I want to know about everything :D,0
8086, Ohhh I see. Well yeah  she did eat a lot of them in Season 3. BUT  there have been no Naomi-banana-eating in Season 4  so for me  she is a garibaldi person. Ask me that question about Garibaldis  then you are sure to get Naomi... :P,0
8085, I went to bed  about 5am  so from that point. No :),0
8084, Stars! They're gorgeous! <3,0
8083, Hmmm  depends on my intentions. If I am going out gardening  then clouds and sun  if im going for a romantic drive with the top down on my car  stars and moon (AS LONG AS ITS STILL WARM) :),0
8065, I believe that is a trick question. Both can happen together ;),0
8066, Nooooo! Don't stop! Because they you have nothing to stop you being bored :( I do it too  but I LOVEEEEEEEE painted nails! I actually LOVEEEEE them :D Mine are always painted  but Im not so into that manicured stuff  I like them to be flashy :) So  don't stop :) If you're bored. Come to me :D,0
8067, What the hell is an 'obstetrician'? :S YOU AREN'T WEIRD!!! :) You are amazing! No weirdness is in amazing  so I let you go freeeeeee  free from your weirdness. Okay  yeah  I think im weird :/ lol,0
8068, Okay...,0
8069, Of course ;),0
8070, Stealing my questions now are we? :P Well I haven't thought much about the first few  the how many I want  their names etc. I don't know if I want boys or girls either  probably girls  but it doesn't really matter to me. I know I definitely want to have children  but in the relationship  I can see myself more as the caring person  so I don't know if I would have the children necessarily. I suppose you can have a child each (keep popping them out ;) lol) but  I don't know if I really want to actually have one. Its hard to say really  im not in a position at the moment where I want kids here and now  definitely not  so I guess I can comment more near the time :),0
8071, Awww bless you!,0
8072, :((((((( I would  but then you actually wouldn't get to watch it  and I know you want to watch it. How about I come over and comfort you instead? :),0
8105, Oooo  this is difficult  I would say back massage :) A good back massage can let everything melt away :))))) I haven't had one in years though :(,0
8073, HAHAHAHAHA! Twitter is pretty dead. At least im making an impact :),0
8075, No its okay  I got it in the end :P I read it first like 'huh?' lol. I got it  I was just being blonde :P,0
8076, Sorry :),0
8077, Hahaha! Okay  so we need somewhere relaxing  and Im not a hugeeeee lover of JUST beaches. But somewhere with a nice beach  a good nightlife (because I can imagine its not the best in Alaska)  and somewhere with a really nice hotel ;) How aboutttttt  Los Angeles? In the summer obviously? Have you ever been there? Or would you want to get out of america?  I went there and I loved it  but I wasn't (and Im still not) 21 so I couldn't go out :( But it looked pretty lively and there again you have the beach to relax upon too :) So  what do you think? Its not TOO hot either  well it wasn't when I went so it sounds like a nice plan :) Lots of sunset walks and going out for dinner? Or staying in and ordering room service ;) lol,0
8078, Done and dusted :P You need a Harry Potter cape thing  not that I watch it  but you know.,0
8079, Hmmm  Salad :),0
8080, Linguine :) Im not a massive fan of spaghetti actually :(,0
8081, Thanks :D <3,0
8082, It depends on what its for. I like spontaneity in a relationship  I think the unexpected things can keep love alivvvvvvvve. Stability with things I need lol. For example &quot;Kel  you don't need your car today do you?&quot; &quot;yeah  why?&quot; &quot;Oh  your dad just lent it to a friend&quot; &quot;.......&quot; lol,0
8074, Its okay  you needed to geek out about the show  and I wasn't around to actually chat :) soooo  all in all  just formspring me any random spurts you get. That would sort things out nicely :D,0
7851, yes im bored...lol,0
7850, and who is &quot;I'm&quot;? :),0
7849, YAYYYYY! :D,0
7619, I mayyy be ;) There is nothing to fall for? HUH?! lol! Have you seen you? Have you met you? Do you know you? Nope :P Obviously not...lol. There is everything to fall for  you are amazing  simples :) <3,0
7620, It depends  but usually around 11:30/12 by the time I get home :( Sometimes earlier if I can blag my way out lol :P,0
7621, I just found this!!!!! WAHEY!!!!!! :D Well I have spoken to you since  but you just toodled off to bed  soooo  I miss you again :P I was anyway  so any way of me saying I didn't miss you would be me lying :P &quot;Hey! What do you mean! I didn't say that! Kelly mind is lying  this is Kelly's voice  just don't listen to her&quot; <<< No  Kelly voice is lying. You know me  im not going to deny it. MISSSSS YOUUUUUUU! (I think I have been drinking a bit too much :/ Hmmmmm.....) <33333333,0
7622, I DID! AND I DO!!!! :'(,0
7623, Indeedo! I need to return the favour don't I? :),0
7624, Haha  its cute you have such an obsession with Greys <3,0
7625, Cute cute :) There is nothing wrong with that :),0
7626, Woahhhhhhhhh! Really? Thanks!  I wondered how you found that out  so I went onto my profile and couldn't see how you totaled that up  so I came to the conclusion that you added them up one by one ;) Then I scrolled down  and was disappointed that you hadn't :P haha!  Im glad im keeping you entertained :D You are keeping me entertained by asking them  so all in all we both win :),0
7627, I think this was posted yesterday  so in which case  I am indeed :P,0
7628, Warm :),0
7629, Leaning towards cold  but Im at a perfectly good temp thanks :),0
7630, hahahaha  its not the age. 16 year old  its not the age ;),0
7631, YEAH!!! <33333 WOOOO FOR THE HOMENESS!!! :D,0
7632, Well its a double bed  and its quite a low one. Its about 1ft off the ground :) Its black and has leather sections. I <3 it! Everyone has said that my bed is comfy! Not that everyone has slept in it O_O I just mean friends :P lol,0
7633, CLIMATE CHANGEEEE...ahem...I have no idea. Please  I would like to know the answer to that. Yesterday it was sunny (ish)  still cold  but the sun was out  today  PISS DOWN WITH RAINNNN! Odd...,0
7634, Haha! Maybe we're both delusional :P Works out nicely then :),0
7635, Because you don't know the battery is dead UNTIL you press harder :),0
7618, haha! Well  no one can read your mind  but can you explain it??? ;) ;) lol! Or do I just need to use my imagination again? :P and thank you <3 :D,0
7636, Well  a little while ago  I started chatting online  and I was always up until very late hours of the morning speaking to them  only because I wanted to  no other reason. Well  I did it  continuously for several months  and now  whenever I try to go to bed earlier  (even if im absolutely shattered) I just can't get to sleep :( My sleeping pattern is REALLY messed up  and although I wouldn't go back to change it  I still need to sort something out  but I don't know what. I have been to the doctors about it  several times  and the final time  he eventually perscribed me some medication. Thing is  it was a pretty heavy dose of something that was VERY addictive and caused a lot of bad side effects. I started to take them  and they didn't make ay difference at all. I finished the packet  and they made no change to my sleeping that there wasn't a point in continuing and getting hooked on anything dangerous. So all in all  im pretty screwed :( I go to bed  perhaps 3am  but I don't get to sleep until about 5/6am and im normally woken up not long after with my family leaving to go to work. So I go back to sleep  im woken again  and this continues until I actually get up a few hours later.  I think this needs to be sorted :( I need my life back :'(,0
7617, Low beds :) Im not a fan of big high ones  although they look more comfortable. Im a very modern person  and I like the ones that are lower  not on the floor  but ones that enable more wall space :),0
7615, Hmmmm  I don't know whats hidden  but I have talents :) I have played the piano since I was about 7  the drums since I was 10  I came top of my school with my art and music grades and coursework. I completed one of the top pieces of work in my college course. Plus other things  but I don't want to continue and make you think I feel a lot about myself lol. I don't  Im just proud of some of my achievements :),0
7598, You spelt it wrong. I think we covered that I had? Earlier :/,0
7599, Yeah  I had noticed :( Any particular reason? Busy? :( I have missed you as a matter of fact  don't be distant :) and I wouldn't miss you so much. Sorted :D,0
7600, I went to do other things :) aka tweet you all back ;),0
7601, Well  I have never really been in a serious relationship. Call it weird  but I never have. I pretty insecure about myself  so I don't have the confidence to approach or start talking to someone.  My parents don't approve about my sexuality though  so I never share anything with them about being in a relationship :),0
7602, No  No and the time from when I finish work  yes :) So the first and the second kind of rolled in to one really. Im having trouble dealing with something and  you know what that is  but its REALLY dragging me down. I don't know how to deal with it  and its actually driving me beyond insane :( Looking forward to next week  because its hopefully when I can do some stuff for me :),0
7603, Indeed I am... Are you? ;),0
7604, How did you guess? ;);),0
7605, It depends on who you are for me to have missed :P,0
7606, Haha  okay  im getting it :) Sorry  I thought I was pronouncing words weird for a moment :S lol!,0
7607, She's homeeeeeee!!!!!!! *dances around room!* ;);) How have you been? :D,0
7608, Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii :) What happens if I take your nose? Can you deal with just a : and a )?,0
7609, Hey tee tee ;),0
7610, YO YO CARLA!!! where have you been? 86'd yourself from being online :'(,0
7611, Helllllo? *waits for person to introduce themselves*,0
7612, Hmmm  they are your best friend because they use noses? You are excited because they use noses too? Aren't you special :P ITS CUTEEEEE! LOL,0
7613, Indeed. Makes up the majority of the universe  Pussies :P,0
7614, HAHAHA! Hi Rosie :P,0
7616, Lowish bed  large bed  soft bed :) I prefer lower beds  only because it gives you more wall space that the bed is resting against. Which leaves more room to be creative and flow with personality :D,0
7637, Beyond cool! They are such normal people though  nothing has gone to their heads  and you can imagine them being friends rather than someone famous and as a result intimidating :) A bit of a blur though...,0
7638, Well mum has since tried to set me up with guys  and she constantly talks about me &quot;happily married with my husband&quot;  so she is still in that denial phase. Not good when I initially told her. My dad  has forgotten I think  either that or he didn't take it seriously in the first place. If im honest  to me  my parents have nothing to do with my sexuality  its my issue  my life :),0
7639, My friends used to talk about boys  and I never felt anything they were describing until I realised  everything they were saying  for me applied to certain girls :/ In the beginning  mainly odd celebrities  but once I was open to it and I had tuned in  I realised it could be anyone (not necessarily famous) :),0
7662, No sugar. Just sweetner. Depends on the size of mug :) On average  perhaps 12 ;),0
7663, As many times as I can say &quot;Asshole&quot;...,0
7664, Oh Lordy!!!,0
7665, Too many times :S 2/3 times (plus return) a year?,0
7666, Too many :S I don't even like the beach that much  thats why it's too many. The first time I ever stepped foot on a beach  I burst out crying because I didn't like the sand between my toes LOL! I was rather young though  so cut me some slack :P,0
7667, Stop using Skins quotes :P,0
7668, I think we're very similar :) I mean we agree on a lot of things  and have the same personality traits. Obviously Im slightly older than you are  but we still have a lot in common. Our views and values appear to be the same too  along with our priorities in life :) You are a slightly late version of me HAHA!,0
7669, I don't know really. Im not one of those people that NEEDS to go out to have a good time. Sure  I Would like to go out with my partner  but staying in  cuddling up watching a good movie is just as nice :) It all depends on what mood im in (not  like that ;) lol) and if there was somewhere I really wanted to go. Im pro originality lol  do something different than your average 'dinner date' :),0
7670, Whenever I get hungry I suppose.,0
7671, Go out? In the sense leave my house? lol Probably every day  unless im ill or something :(,0
7672, 20 and a half :),0
7673, 20 :),0
7674, I guess I just feel my age  I don't know how it feels to feel old  so I suppose 20?,0
7675, Depends on how wrinkly I get. No pre 80s shit though :) If Im one of those old ladies still able to line-dance and pee by themselves  Im all for the old age!,0
7676, Thats kind of hard to answer actually. Remember 'Time for Coffee?'  my fanfic? Well  that was based on something I had with a girl from work  so its hard to say really. Technically we weren't dating  but there was obviously something there.,0
7677, I have never really been taken on a date lol. Call it sad  but Im not a big one for relationships and I have never had anything serious  so the term 'date' hasn't been big in my life :(,0
7678, I would like to think im pretty romantic. I don't think you need much to be romantic or spontaneous  its just about being original and making something special for the other half.,0
7661, I don't put sugar in my tea :) I use sweetener though  like 3 :),0
7660, Hmmm  I think you asked about 15/20? Its about fair I do the same right? :D,0
7659, Umm  2 pairs I think. Im not a pyjama person  I tend to wear jogging bottoms or shorts with t-shirts and tank tops depending on the weather :) If its REALLLLLLY cold  then a hoodie too  and really hot  then a tank top and pants? lol,0
7658, 46 in total..lol. I also promised someone else LOADDDDSSSS to make up for all these. So yes  all night :),0
7640, LOADS! Its weird  why can't we all have the same system? That would make it so much easier :),0
7641, Hmmm  it depends on what it was. I am one of those people who stay quiet for a while then kind of explode a bit :S It really depends on who I was with and whether I would feel comfortable talking things out  you know? Hopefully it would involve exploding that way :),0
7642, Im really smitten with that person  and I give everything I possibly could to that person to make them feel as special as I do for being with them :) As you know by now  Im a romantic kind of person  so I would give everything I had into it :) Other than that  pretty damn happy when Im with them  and really mopey when I miss them :'(,0
7643, Thats when I go quiet  definitely. I probably give pretty short answers too  its usually easy to tell (if you know me well enough) that I am upset about something. Either that  or I come ranting to you <3,0
7644, I don't know im afraid. Some people follow their heart  some people their head. I guess it all depends on which you think will work out best.,0
7645, I just look for things that make me happy or I can escape to :) No matter how bad things can get  there is always something that can cheer you up. So I guess its about concentrating on those things? :),0
7646, The don't. You have just been mistaken :),0
7647, Okay  so basically. When we start education (at about 4/5 years) we start primary school  which goes from reception  then year one  through to year 6 (all completed yearly). Then  we go to secondary school  starting in year 7 (age 10/11) all the way through to year 11 (15/16). In years 3  6 and 9  we complete 'SATS' which are like little test things determining how well we are doing in school. In year 11  we complete our GCSE's  which are the qualifications that a lot of employees look at when interviewing you. Then we finished school and go to college to study a-levels for 2 years  generally before people go onto university to study a chosen subject at age 17/18 for a final degree. How about yours? Its always confused me :P lol,0
7597, Ummmm  I think all above for the previous question actually :(,0
7648, Hmmm  it depends day to day  generally on when I fall to sleep. Perhaps 11:30 or something? But I wake up before  and just lie there lol!,0
7650, Lol  thank you!!! You tell me? What's wrong with me? There must be a reason right? Perhaps its the insecure issue :( lol <33333,0
7651, I don't have a clue! Its dark  and all the blinds are closed. Im not walking outside by myself to check  unless you join me? :P,0
7652, Well we have had a lot of rain the past couple of days  but for now  its steady :) Still wet and cold out though :(,0
7653, Ummm  well I go to bed any time from about 3 until 5  and im usually asleep at about 6/7? I suffer from REALLY bad insomnia  hence why Im always up late at night  and why I normally sleep on in the day :),0
7654, I think it was about 40/50? lol!  but my Twitter update limit ran out in between  so im answering all now :D,0
7655, 2 floors :) Well three if you include the loft :/,0
7656, I actually have a really small family. In my close family  its me  my sister (who is 23) and our parents. Then I have one gran  2 uncles  one aunt and 2 cousins. Although I hardly see both of my uncles  they aren't really bothered about keeping in contact with the family  so eventually we have sort of lost touch :( I haven't seen one of my cousins for about 4/5 years. He got married  and ended up forgetting about his own family to move in on his wifes family and friends. So basically  that leaves my nan  cousin and aunt are the only people I really see. Its pretty sad :( My cousin  her dad (one of the uncles) also treated her really badly as a child (deliberately left her out of things  made her eat at a separate table over dinner  sent her to bed when she did nothing wrong  wouldn't let her go outside etc) so its another reason why the family don't worry about the uncle excusing himself from the family.  Both of my other grandparents have passed away :( Grampy when I was 3  Nan when I was 5 (and I still remember that :'() and 'Pop' (grandfather) when I was 15. So  a pretty small loose family unit I would say :(,0
7657, Well I studied French and German at school  but I have forgotten pretty much all of it. I would like to speak French and Spanish fluently though  I have just never gotten around to learning them properly :),0
7649, hahaha! These questions today :P If im honest  im not one of those people who would sleep with anyone and everyone there and then. I like to get to know people before  lets say 'getting intimate' with them. Its hard to say  because you connect differently with different people  and I think you can judge a lot from a first meeting  so it completely depends on the person and my feelings for them :),0
7679, 5'11&quot; :) Pretty tall  hence not being able to wear heels :P Hey  at least it means im usually stable :D,0
7596, I have :P,0
7594, Actually yes. I used to take lessons for about 3 years. I went through jumps and everything  I really enjoyed it too  but then they stopped lessons at that area :(,0
7534, Hmmm  how about both? Together :D,0
7535, HAHAHAHAHA! Thanks! (O) _ (O) Good niiiiiiight!!! *growls back in a sexy tone* LOL!,0
7536, YOU TOOOOOO! When you go to bed that is! Im actually going now  so I will speak to you tomorrow night :( I will miss you until then :'( Sleep well gorgeous! <3,0
7537, Hmmmmmm  now I know this is from one of two people. Is that you Tori? I think Im correct :D HOWDY! I have never properly watched it  but I probs will one day :) Any episodes I should skip to?,0
7538, Hmmm  is the ground dirty? then chair :) Unless there is something I can sit on  then that. OR if im wearing a skirt or dress  nahhh  still chair :) Im classy like that ;),0
7539, Oh nooooooo! I think you should develop that a bit more :P Carry on....what you were thinking half the time....? ;),0
7540, haha! Im more of a fluff lover :P But angst can be a massive importance in all that fluff creation! LOL! Actually nahhh  angst is good too. I like Fics where (Naomily wise) They get together in the story rather than being in a relationship. I think most relationships are best in the discovery period  if that makes sense? :) Film? Ohhh yeah Im excited! ITs gonna be scary  but im sure I will get used to it :D,0
7541, Im guessing thats &quot;aloha&quot; hello  and not the goodbye. In which case I will continue... So its a bit like Skins then? Getting to know the characters  then into the second season  create a whole load of angst :) My day  well started off nicely lol. Did some odd random creative things today  but had an argument with my dad which put me in a really bad mood lol. Im okay now :) You guys have sparked me out of it  sooooo  THANK YOU :D How have you been? :),0
7542, Ummmmm  I can't even think where I do live at the moment :S Ummmmmmmmmm  oh I remember! I do live sort of near a park  but its REALLY scary at night. Best avoid. I have an idea  I have a giant trampoline outside in my garden. How about I pull out the heat lamp thing from the garage  but it over the trampoline  and we can sit on there and chat looking up at the sky? Orrrrr beach works nicely too :D I think I prefer the beach  but I don't love them in the day. I like nice walks along the beach during sunset <33333 thats lush! But Im not a big fan of sunbathing  its just boring :S lol!,0
7543, :( Well we shall both keep an eye out  if anything makes either of us laugh  post it on here  cool? :D Hug? :),0
7544, Awwwwwwwww..never to be seen again. The End. Sad times. I hope they are doing well in life ;),0
7545, Hmmmm  well lets think... For day wear  how about something like this: http://www.polyvore.com/now_feel_overwhelmed_you/set?id=17126145 It has earthy tones  but its well balanced plus its very casual quite comfortable. It you still wanted to stay very girly  and for a warm summer evening BBQ lets say something like this: http://www.polyvore.com/running_away_from_you/set?id=16955552 OR this: http://www.polyvore.com/sweet_memories/set?id=16463192 For an evening look  perhaps dinner out or an evening at the pub maybe a punked up and spicier look: http://www.polyvore.com/baby_you_rock/set?id=16444872 Perhaps going out to a club scene or something a bit more dressed up  a black ensemble? http://www.polyvore.com/bez_naslova/set?id=15743111 and because I know you like Jeans  how about a comfortable warmer option? :) http://www.polyvore.com/love_this_jeans/set?id=15496984 What do you think of the sorts of things so far? Quiet varied  but it can express personality or mooooood :) <3333,0
7546, :( I would :) Its odd how such small things like that can feel so warming isn't it :D,0
7547, Well  personally I think you should tell me where YOU think my imagination SHOULD be going ;);) I don't have much to go by  so you say better than some fanfics you have read? and you are a smut liker yessssss? Hmmmmm *explodes imagination* ;);) lol!,0
7548, Well  that may sound a tad good ;) lol! European accents huh? Wellllll  any in particular? :P lol. You can be my manequin then! What kind of things do you like? Or inspire to like? Colours? Styles? fits? Dressers? skirts? Jeans? Leggings? Just so I can start planning ;) <3333,0
7549, I think you're funny :) No one elses opinions matter  only yoursssss :D,0
7550, HAHA! Nahh  its a good addiction :) You keep my mind off of other things  and thats a gooooood thing :D So  please continue raping my formspring and twitter wall :P lol I think they have gotten rid of elephants in Circus' haven't they? Im glad  they deserve to be freeeeeeeee...,0
7533, Well  in a jewellery sense  Gold? lol,0
7551, Are you actually accident prone? Or just in the dream? :P,0
7532, Awwwww  now you know how I feel when you are at school :P Soooo  I think  how about I quit my job  and you quit school? They we wouldn't be crazy and everyone stays sane. Poor and dumb  but at least we are sane and have each other ;) ha!,0
7530, Sure thannnnng :),0
7513, At the moment  Ellie Goulding- 'Starry Eyed' (Jackwob remix),0
7514, Mint Chocolate chip  UNLESS its Ben &amp; Jerry's :) ANY flavour of Ben and Jerry's would suit me amazingly :D And Im not even an ice-cream person :D,0
7515, Hmmm  well 'the one' may not actually be the one. You know? I think everyone should fight for the right person  but it depends on how that effects that other person too. For example  say 'the one' was someone that perhaps didn't feel the same OR didn't treat you how you deserved to be treated  then I would settle for someone amazing  because in turn  that could be the one. It's all about giving them a chance :),0
7516, Joel was the local milkman  and Jane was his friendly cactus...,0
7517, Hmm  well considering electric heaters are portable  I would say electric heaters. They go right to the source of non-heat :P lol Fires are cosier though  and they do look a lot nicer. So it depends on how cold I actually am  and where abouts I am sat :),0
7518, Yellow.,0
7519, Candy  because then you can share it with the giver :),0
7520, HAHA! In real life or in fanfiction? lol Well in fanfiction  fluff :) Especially when its all romantic and cute to read  because like you said  that can lead to smut too haha! As for real life  I would probably say fluff again :) Im more a fan of cute moments than...other moments ;) haha,0
7521, Oh other people definitely! I like to help people out (partially because it distracts me from my own shit) :P,0
7522, Thats nice  share the love (perhaps by yourself) o_O,0
7523, Well I have visited France many times  and I didn't really love it :S So I would say Italy :) Perhaps you can show me sometime? ;),0
7524, I have never heard italian :( But I do like French. You speak italian right? I think you should make a video of you saying it  I think you are the onlyyyyyy person who is able to deter me from my love of French :P,0
7525, Ummmmmmm  spanish language. Food wise  I HATE the french food  well savory things anyway :S EUGHHH! They eat weird stuff! So I suppose Spanish savory things? I do like the Spanish language though  its rather sexy ;),0
7526, Fruits :) Especially Pineapple! YUMMMMMMY! :D,0
7527, Nahhhhh. To be fair  she cant sing that well. She has a nice voice for the songs she sings  but there again  she is written them based on her voiced. I dont think Louise would agree with you there ;),0
7528, When I see that others are happy. Orrrrrr  if I do something for someone  and I see it is really appreciated  that is one of the best feelings you can have :D I like to do things for other people  and its not generally returned  but still  I do love the feeling of giving :),0
7529, I thought it was &quot;Brap Brap&quot;?,0
7531, A nice balance of both :) But I must admit  I am a very generous and giving person...work it out ;),0
7552, Ohhhhhh! Got it! I do that at times  only when I don't concentrate or something. I think its actually funny! I wouldn't call it an inpediment but thats just me (probably because I do it) anywayyyy....I think its funny. Its cute you do it and can at least laugh at yourself :),0
7553, You disappeared last night missy!!! :P I was DMing you  tweeting you and formspringing you  and you disappeared :( Anywayyyyy  You're in your SAT's right now  hopefully writing away :D,0
7554, You loved reading it? Pshhh  was boring :P lol I think both of ours were a bit depressing  but thats the things that stick out most in life  so automatically we remember the sad things over the happier things. Its how our minds work :) Hmmm  future plans. Well apart from wanting a family  and to be happily in love with a successful home and car etc etc As for career plans  my ultimate goal would be to direct independent horror films :) I love how some of them can contain so much art (visually) as they can video. When I say independent  I mean things like &quot;The Descent&quot;  &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;  &quot;28 Days Later&quot; etc etc. Im not so much into big budget epic Hollywood movies  because it takes the essence out of capturing a moving image on film. They rely too much on special effects nowadays  and I prefer the retro approach to film making :),0
7577, Pretty much  but it has got worse in the past year or so. I think  I do too much at night lol. I used to try and do all my college work at night which meant I ended up staying up really late  concentrating and went to bed with an energetic mind. Also  my job  because I get home VERY late in comparison to normal jobs   and the work that I do  involves your mind to be VERY active and stuff (ie remembering loads of things to do in your head) I come home  and Im still not able to go to bed until my head has calmed down a bit. So yeah  now its just got worse and worse and worse  but Im dealing :) I think I should just move into your time zone. Just saying :P,0
7578, Well no  but I had an incident at an Airport where I was taken into a security office and questioned for taking photographs of the outside. They thought I could have been a teenage  white  beret wearing terrorist :P lol,0
7579, I have yeah! Some action outing day thing during school. Wasn't fun  especially getting stuck in the potholes underground :/,0
7580, no  but I really really want to snow board. Just because its so different and there is nothing else like it out there. I want to learn so badly  but in proper snow  not ski slopes  has to be the proper stuff :),0
7581, No  but I went through a phase of ALWAYS wanting to do it (probably stemmed from watching too much Buffy :P),0
7582, I actually have lol! I was on a college trip to prague  and one night when we went out  the guys wanted to go to this strip club thing. It was pretty funny  because if you were female  it was free to get in  but the boys had to pay.  The night was rather lame  because it was about our 3rd night out in a row  and 4 days without sleep  I was sat on a couch just watching people  not knowing where to look lol! I was only 16  so it was damn illegal to be there  but thats prague for you :P Then I was looking for someone  and I ended up falling down the stairs LOL! Good times...,0
7583, I think everyone at some point has taken some form of drug  but you mean the illegal kind yeah? Well  yes. Some good  some...not so good :(,0
7584, HAPPY VALENTINES DAY TOO! (Even though I dont really agree with it :P) Personally  I dont think that there can be love at first sight. I think there can be what is described as a very strong connection  but I dont think it is instantly love. I could never love someone without knowing their personality first  so  for me. I have no belief  but I think you can determine whether you could love them from a first meeting :),0
7585, Yes unfortunately :( Ever read my fanfic 'Time for Coffee?' That was a BAD 'fall for' :(,0
7586, HAHAHA! No I haven't. I don't take busses very often  besides I have a car now  which I don't fart in either lol.,0
7587, Yes  but its never been anything serious :(,0
7588, I dont think so  at least  I cant remember one while sober O_O,0
7589, haha! I don't think I ever did the imaginary friend thing. Did you? Was it good? Did I miss much?,0
7590, Just to piss of Miss Da Silva of Canada  next question...,0
7591, No  never even heard of it. What's it about?,0
7592, You would be rather stuck for questions wouldn't you? Awww  poor Tee-tee :P,0
7593, Ermmmm  I may have. What one is it? What's it about?,0
7576, HaHa! Okayyy  lets think... Nothing that is insulting please (and yes I have had insulting things as a name  only because they rhyme  I promise  im not actually 'smelly' lol) So Smelly Kelly  Jelly Kelly  Kelly Belly  Kelly Telly (which is just odd) and no Kell Bell. So other than that  you have free reign :D I get called 'fred' by my mum all the time  I have no idea why  its just been my name for AGESSSSSS. So  up to you :D ANYTHING YOU LIKE!!!! Bar the above ;) I know why you can't think of anything  its because im too damn special to describe in one word ;) haha! joke ;P,0
7575, During School  yes :/ Smelly Kelly  Kelly Welly  kell bell  kelly telly  fred... All from my friends too! Keepers huh? :P lol,0
7574, Collections? Do you mean  do I collect stuff? Well  its funny you ask that  because I used to be a collect-a-holic! Literally anything and everything! I was a hoarder! lol I have grown out of it a bit now  but I still have a lot of the stuff upstairs. You remember the TVs show Buffy and Angel? Well I LOVED them  and I spent about u00a36 000 or something ridiculous collecting all the merchandise they made. Literally EVERYTHING they would release  I would buy with any pocket money or birthday money I would get. I loved collecting all that  but it took up so much space that it went into the loft :( As for other things  Art Sticks (otherwise known as decorated drum sticks)  guitars  shoes (to an extent)  oh everything! lol! Anything someone could collect  I collected it. :/,0
7573, I am if im honest :) I have decided to be really productive and im making another 'Warning Contains Ideas' bag (aka Naomi's bag from Season 3) and Im in a good mood generally :) I didn't sleep well though :( I got woken up 3 times  due to stupid door bells at horrible times in the morning. Butttttt  im good anyway :) How are you doing?,0
7555, Oh I can relate to that! In person  I think you need more confidence lol. I used to read LOADS of fanfic  and I will admit  I do like to read a nice balance of fluff and smut :P God! Who came up with these words?! haha  epic :) Im sure we could work out a balance in real life ;),0
7556, WTF? Really? That is some disturbing stufffffff! What do they teach you! I think you should come here and study at an English college. Just saying ;),0
7557, haha  no it wasn't creepy  I just didn't understand the question. Well  I do like Bristol  and it is DEFINITELY a good place to go out in  but I will be leaving in about 7 months to go to film school in Brighton (about 4 hours dive away each way).  Its only a year  but when I come back  depending on how film school goes  I may move  completely depending on how my career goes and what opportunities open up for me :) Thanks for asking :),0
7558, HA! Oh dear God...Well...I think  if someone doesn't know me very well  then I can come across as very innocent  but once you know me  perhaps not ;) Well  lets just say  I am very similar to Emily when it comes to being 'innocent' and if I said  that Emily isn't really innocent at all  does that answer your question ;) lol How about you then? (perfect time to return the question) :P,0
7559, Hahahaha! Because I wasn't sure how you would react????????? How would you have reacted? :P,0
7560, THANKS :D But for some reason  it won't let me ask any more? :( Probably not so awesome now :'( I will keep trying :),0
7561, I am? Well thanks :) I don't get told that often  but my humour  its usually stupid humour  so if you find that funny  then cool :),0
7562, Thanks <33333 It makes me cry :'(  Also 'Speechless' by Lady Gaga! LOVE THEM! <3,0
7595, Yes I have actually. I went through a phase when I loved South of Nowhere  and I wanted to be called Ashley LOL! Totally passed  and Im fine with Kelly now :),0
7563, Haha  one or the other works :P Although  I have film school in september  plus my own place. So you can be freeeeeee  I vote you come here instead ;) lol. Plus! Brighton is great for young people  so lots of younger cool vintage shops to find things in :) I WANT TO STYLE YOU NOW!!! lol,0
7565, Hmmm  how about 2 weeks? 2 weeks in hot  and 2 weeks in cold and the rest of the 4 weeks in bed? ;);) hahahaha! :P,0
7566, Well  it depends on where Im going.  If Im going out  then I tend to drink (probably a little too much) straight  to get me &quot;in the mood&quot; then I dont need to drink so much when Im out. Otherwise  if im at home or something  I usually mix i with something and make a cocktail :) Basically  depends on how drunk you want to get lol! Normally yes (to answer your question in a short sentence) but it may just be personally :),0
7567, Haha! The light blue one? Yeahhhhh  thats the cooooool one :P  Good girl ;) lol,0
7568, I wish I was there too! Wish me over? PLEASEEEEE :) I shall bring....ummm....all the snails you can eat? Nice and fresh ;) haha! LOVE YOU TOOOOOO! <333 Oh  and link me up with the photos  I can't find them :'(,0
7569, I wont have a car :(,0
7570, TI.,0
7571, Hand cuffs  as long as they aren't too tight :( Ropes burn :S,0
7572, Hmmmm  well if you mean literally now. I'm not thinking about much  which means im quite content :) Now that im talking to you  8? How about yourself? :D,0
7564, I WOULD LOVE TO!!!! I love dressing people up and putting outfits together!!! Totally! Come to England and YOU'RE MINEEEEEEEEE!!!! &quot;mwah ha ha ha ha&quot; ;),0
7511, Hmmmm  I actually LOVE homemade Carbonara :D Or at least the recipe that I found for it. Its GORGEOUS!!!!! <33333,0
7680, Oh trust me  thats nothing! You should see my entire wardrobe :S Im such a girl when it comes to clothing lol. 30 pairs of jeans? Well  I don't even wear jeans  so if i'm honest  its completely pointless in owning them.,0
7682, Well it wasn't too great. Apart from feeling REALLY terrible  I have had a few problems over twitter (most of which I have told you over a question  near the end I think). I have been being driven slightly insane  but you're going to find out why in a bit :) Anyway  im off to bed  so I shall speak to a certain someone tomorrow! Until then  I SHALL MISS YOUUUUU :( Sleep well when you go to bed :D <333,0
7789, No  it keeps going. They you call for an ambulance when you get to your intentional stop. Its all the rage here in England...,0
7790, They just make him sit on it instead. But don't break wind otherwise it might be misplaced...,0
7791, Because it doesn't have the 'ring' to it orange does. When you see the colour orange  and you say 'orange' it makes you want one. Soooooo  its product placement. I mean  name something natural that is also orange?  But name something that is yellow or green. LOADSSSSSSS.,0
7792, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I dread to think O_O,0
7793, These are random mind bursts aren't they? Kind of riddles in a way  but still...an educational answer is probably needed. Sucks that you came to me with it then ;),0
7794, Hmm  okay so can I say a boat? :P For obvious reasons... A laptop  to contact you obviously :) and a power outlet to keep myself charged :D,0
7795, OF COURSE! Playing the blonde extra girl from S4 Episode 4 would do nicely...,0
7796, No chance  unless im eating with you. Sucks to be you :P,0
7797, I would run over  envelope you in a hug  find out why you were crying. Hug you some more  talk about it. Try to make you laugh  try to talk through sorting it out (if it were possible) and hug you again until you calmed down :),0
7798, I would indeed! Actually  I would ask you to cook WITH me :) Because I think thats nicer  besides  its cute to cook with someone :) As long as it doesn't end up in a food fight! Okay ;) Hmm  what would we cook? Whatever you wanted to eat  thats what we would cook :D,0
7799, Hug you back :D Probably harder :),0
7800, It depends on who kissed me :),0
7801, Jump out of my Skin!!! lol Then be like &quot;WTF?! WHAT IS IT?!&quot; Then if it was something scary  protect you :P,0
7802, Probably say 'cool' and change the subject :P I am very open minded :) Oh  as long as you don't have a ginger beard. That would be a tad of an issue  especially being a girl and all ;) lol,0
7803, You can call me anything you wanted to :D Apart from KellBell  Kelly Belly  Smelly Kelly  Kelly welly... I don't love those names  and why does my name have to rhyme with so many insults :'( lol,0
7804, FREAKING DAMN COLD! But it's already freezing  so im going to say  freezing ice. :/,0
7805, I would do anything that enables me and my family/friends to be happy. Whatever that meant  I would do it :),0
7788, Audience? There is no audience  we are all the entertainers  the aliens are the audience but they don't sit. They hover :),0
7806, Ermmmm  I have NO clue. My life has taken many turns and gone to many different places  so I don't think I could pick any :/ You can take elements from lots of different songs  its all about thinking about how they relate to you. Most songs relate to most people  its just about linking them :),0
7787, I doubt it...I would end up hanging myself from a tree due to pure terror lol!,0
7785, It still makes a sound  because the animals and wildlife still hear it :) I think it gets away with being made fun of though. Just barely...,0
7768, Do you like emo music? ;),0
7769, HAHAHA! I take it the &quot;asker&quot; is a Canadian? ;) What can I say  you are from the same family (you're close enough). Live with it  I love you all!! :D,0
7770, Ohhh yeah! I have been on fanfiction.net  but I live on LJ most of the time :) I expect I have read some of your work  you are pretty big in the Skins community :),0
7771, and who is Katie? There is only one Katie that doesnt need a name  but she has a last name called Fitch ;) lol (If you aren't a fan of Skins  this will not make any sense to you :P),0
7772, I should be asking the same question :/ Except im not quite as bored ( I don't think) :),0
7773, Best put some ice on that...,0
7774, Hmmmm  surprise me :D I love anything with chocolate in though (as you know ;)) But white chocolate cookies <3333333 Heavenly :D,0
7775, Hmmm. I don't really know much about the male side of Bristol  and Im not sure if I even understand that question. As an easy answer  yes there are. But they switch between cities as to not stink out a certain area too much :),0
7776, Emily Fitch ;),0
7777, Oh I have an awesome camera  so I shall make sure I bring both  so you can borrow one too :) So what do you think about then going to a hot country to relax and warm up? :),0
7778, Well  isn't it lucky we don't have seven-elevens here then :P Otherwise I would be having words ;),0
7779, Trick question? I think so. All in all  FAILLLLLLLLLLLL! The book....and the so called success...,0
7780, :O I had exactly this issue with the job I last worked at! lol! Someone who I worked with  and don't get me wrong  they were really lovely  but they were a pathological liar but they never admitted to it  it was just really obvious.  So  I guess you don't because they are just the attention seekers :P,0
7781, I never even use the term 'silverware' so luckily  this dilema will never apply to me...,0
7782, Well  if he does or not  a mute child must use their hands A LOT more than people who can speak do  so he probably should wash his hands more yes. Go mum  GOOOOOO! Trip to the soap...,0
7783, HHAHAHAHA! I have never even thought of that! Well apparently we could only live on the crust of the earth  so I guess they own it to the end of the crust? o_O,0
7784, I think that they should go down with the ship yes... The ship was their routine  the routine went down (literally) so  bye bye other person. You have to keep up now don't you? Make sure you both flap in time...cheers...,0
7786, I think he has a BAREEEE BACKSIDE!!! Someone get this thing a towel! There are kiddies around! Ohhhh looook! I just saw his winky! *giggles* :P,0
7807, &quot;Hey holes! How you guys doing?!&quot; &quot;we got lost!&quot; &quot;Oh shit  why was that?&quot; &quot;Because hole over the there is too fat  and we all fell down&quot; lol! :P,0
7808, I for one  would dart out of the way and look at him side on. If his nose doesn't grow  I would be majorly disappointed and grab the dearest frying pan  smacking him on the face until another lump makes the development that the nose should have done...,0
7809, Obviously some quitter... :( WAY TO SET AN EXAMPLE DUDE!,0
7832, Well unless he is planning on taking you around the world the long way  then he owes you the money yeah! Actually  they should do that! It would be a free fare and still get you home!,0
7833, Woahhh? A billion dollars? Well  I would make sure I am settled with everything I would need  plus my family and friends. Then I would give a lot to charities  to smaller charities  because the mainstream ones get a lot from exposure  then put the rest into an account for future family members. I wouldn't want to be that kind of person where it changes who I am. But still  I wouldn't mind it ;),0
7834, Independent :),0
7835, A million bucks. Because what can you really achieve by flying?  1) you would look extremely odd 2) With a million bucks you can buy flying equipment :),0
7836, Ummmm  chocolate bar <333 Also  I heard you can lose weight if you eat only chocolate? Thats a bonus right? haha! So yeah  chocolate. Ummm  maybe Twirl or wispa  yeah  twirl <3333 or Time out :D,0
7837, Ohhhh  I think I have heard that somewhere! I don't know where  but somewhere. Perhaps I just read your mind...who knows...,0
7838, I don't even have a clue what that is o_O Obviously its something self diagnosed  yes?,0
7839, You have failed...pure and simple...so as a result  succeeded :),0
7840, They cancel each other out  so I do nothing...use it on myself instead :) Im a hardcore genie  I bent rules...,0
7841, A tree? Well  I wasn't aware that trees can tell the difference between things  but I see where you are going with this. I would say a Willow tree  only because I love to be protective of the ones that I love  and as a Willow  I can spread my branches and give shelter to those who need it :) (EXCUSE CHEESY ANSWER  thanks ;)),0
7842, Ermmmmm  can't say I have ever thought about that question. So  I would say beefy like Mr T!! Phwarrrrrr! ;) and go around giving out free chocolate bars for sex ;) HAHA!,0
7843, You would  but you would never be able to leave it. So  its a bit like  the &quot;you can look  but don't touch rule&quot;....IT PLAIN SUCKS!,0
7844, HAHA! Well I think I am VERY much like you  so in that sense  I probably am weird. ORRRRR  you are very much like me  in which sense  you AREN'T weird. Take your pick there missy :P,0
7845, I don't think it would really be my place to get involved  but it would completely depend on their lover. If I thought  they treated my friend badly in the first place  I probably would just stay out of it  whereas if they didn't deserve it  I would try and intervene and tell my friend to sort herself out  and tell them  or break it off. It's not fair to lie either way :(,0
7846, Im already a heroine ;),0
7847, I certainly did think so :P So  can I become a major role in your new  business? PLease? Can I be the executive manager and steal some too? :),0
7848, Sure thannnnnng :) I shall happily await :),0
7831, It would make life a little interesting wouldn't it? I mean  take job interviews for example  &quot;are you hardworking and have a long concentration span?&quot; &quot;yeah....course&quot; &quot;Well  I think you are lying because you have a pot belly. NEXT!&quot; :D lol,0
7830, It depends what the stress is over. If its a fight with a person  or im angry at them for whatever reason  I normally throw something at the wall lol!! I snapped my phone once that way :S BAD MOVEEEEE! :( If its being stressed about being late  or whatever  then I just try and do it as fast as freaking possible! LOL,0
7829, NO lol! Its always someone trying to sell something  and do I really need to listen to that?,0
7828, I DONT CARE IF THIS ISNT POSSIBLE! Emily Fitch :) lol. No  I don't mean Kathryn Prescott  I mean Emily Fitch XD lol.,0
7810, Testical ;),0
7811, No  its out of date then. BUT  regular cream  if its out of date  you just change it to a sour cream pot. They you have a loads of time before you actually need to throw it out :),0
7812, :O I HAVE ALWAYS WONDERED THAT!!! but not enough to properly google it lol. Its odd  but I would really like to know :),0
7813, Ohh yeah  those people. Well they knew you would be calling  so they saw no point ;),0
7814, Hello. Im Kelly. Got a problem?,0
7815, Hmmmm  I think there was a bit of a give away then. The edge  is boring. Deal with it ;),0
7816, The think with romance  I think something that can kill the spontaneity in a relationship  is asking your partner &quot;What should we do? How can I make you happy? Tell me and I will do it&quot;. Apart from the obvious answer that makes most people happy ;) its not romantic to tell someone how you want to be treated. I would feel much better  if my partner made an effort and figured it out. Even if they didn't figure out exactly what I wanted to do  I would love them that much more for making the effort to show me that they love me. Does this make sense?,0
7817, Why would I read my own posts anyway? :P I post them  so there is no point in reading them back  because I already know what they say ;),0
7767, :( Well in good time little one  in good time :),0
7818, You sit in the aisle and they just hop over you :) BESTTTTT view in the HOUSE! :D,0
7820, Ermmmm  a parrot? Because we learn to speak! Which makes us intelligent  and a cross human...soooo. I like being a human  so thats the best way to go :) Besides  I WOULD BE PRETTY!!! WOOP! lol,0
7821, Well  I would say that I am VERY similar to Emily at the moment  and I really hate being so sensitive about things. I would say Naomi  DEFINITELY  because she can cut things off  and basically doesn't give a shit. Im jealous of her ability to do that :(,0
7822, Ummm  its really cold here  so somewhere warm at least :) In bed  all warm and cosy <3333333,0
7823, Now :) Because things seem to be getting better as time goes on. Technology  culture  social acceptance etc etc etc  and also  now is the time where Sexuality isn't so much of a big deal  and I like that. Sooooo  now :),0
7824, Hmmmm. Probably dying my hair red. Unoriginal  but who cares :),0
7825, Toooooo  ermmm  lets think.  Its random  but London's nightlife :) With people obviously  not by myself :),0
7826, Hmmm  the power to turn invisible? Then I would go all Veronica Mars on unsuspecting victims... Orrrrrr The power to read minds. Not scarily like 'Earshot' from Buffy  but be able to home in on one person  and turn it off it I wanted. There goes all insecurity right? :D No more fake friends. Although  the truth can hurt. Okay  lets go back to the invisible one :),0
7827, A BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN :D,0
7819, Ummmm  someone who I would like to try living like perhaps? No one too famous  although I would like to see how feel feels like without having to deal with a lifetime of it. Ummm  I don't know. No one scarily eccentric :S Actually thinking about it  I would like to be Kathryn Prescott for a day :P I would love to know how it feels to have that female attention ;) LOL!,0
7681, It was okay thanks :) Managed to get out of work earlier than expected  so that was nice :) Not the most eventful days  but it could have been worse :) Im sorry to have heard about yours :'(,0
7766, I do enjoy swimming yes :) But I prefer to do it in private pools rather than ones that involve loads of other people swimming with you. So  yours sounds lovely right about now! *takes off SOME clothing and jumps right in* :) I am so jealous of your pool by the way  but there again  here  its too cold to even think about having an outdoor pool :S,0
7764, Thanks. I must remember to always take you with me then :),0
7704, HAHA! I must admit  im not a fan of any crap  geese or no geese :P,0
7705, Oh me tooooooooooo! I remember when I started crying in one of my managers offices and they were just sat there like &quot;..........&quot;. Its like  &quot;no  this isn't embarrassing at all. Just sit there and stare&quot;. I was going through a hard patch  hence crying in the first place lol. But  in actual response to yours  Im not like that :) If someone is crying  I would do my best to comfort them  and that of course includes you <3,0
7706, :( Better get writing. I have an idea! Just write REALLY big :) Sortedddddd...that may have been what I did during school ;),0
7707, Oh I think its a good goal. Hmmmm  who might this mystery person be? Im liking it  I might have to find my own person to make-out with on a park bench in Paris. Hmmm  where can I find them? ;) <33 haha,0
7708, :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( But that means I will miss you too :( I shall await your return happily! :D I will be on tonight  so chat to you then! GOOOOOD LUCK!!!! Have fun! <333,0
7709, It's on Livejournal  and my name is Kellyblake1  the same as on Twitter :) The first chapter is a little way back in my blog though  may have to scan back if you wanted to read :) Anyway  its a Naomily fanfic I wrote  about what has happened to me :) Not exactly obviously  its more eventful for the sake of entertainment lol.,0
7710, Awwwwwwwwww!!! I actually did that tonight  while holding my phone (not a good combination :S). You are going to have a bruise? Come here I will rub it better :) Orrrrr  at least make you forget about it ;) <333,0
7711, Bless you.,0
7712, Good evening :) Orrr  wait 8 minutes. Then its good morning again :D,0
7713, Thats a random song :/ Im bored too. I might pop out and get myself some milk  but I don't know if I can be assed to get ready :/,0
7714, YEahhhh exactly! So you know what im on about. But for you  its 10 times worse :S Obviously different country and all :/ I admire you for making the choice to do that :) ITs AWESOME! Plus  Birmingham is about an hour and a half in a car to BRISTOLLLL! <<< SKINS LAND! ;) lol Yeahhh  come and visit me in Brighton! I will take you out to a local club or something  we can celebrate our victories XD lol,0
7715, Pretty hilarious though! Is that why they are so cheap? Don't pay tax because its a non-biscuit :/,0
7716, Fair point :),0
7717, Thank you :) My parents obviously agreed.,0
7718, I DOOOOOOO! Apart from in the beginning when I was getting some REALLY awkward questions :) No  wait....I still loved it :D,0
7719, Glad to hear that. Judging from the pictures of &quot;Shed&quot; I don't want to know the conversations that happen during shed talk :P,0
7720, Well what if I said I loved you <333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333 Much? Hard to beat right? RIGHTTTTTT? ;),0
7703, Good gooooooooood :),0
7721, Awwwww  well thank you!! :D Why wouldn't they let you? You want to make it look pretty yeah? I assume its not to dig up loads of mud and plonk it on their cars  so why would they say no? They like pretty right? :),0
7702, No  its not unoriginal :) If you wanted to know something about me  just ask it :D  So I ask you something perhaps you want to know about me? Bingo! Ask ask ask :D,0
7700, Well something must have worked :D You're all better now right? :P,0
7683, Im not really the person who does the asking out  if im completely honest. I don't have very much self confidence (as you should know from reading my answers already)  so its not a move I would generally do. I leave it up to the other person  hence why I am probably still single lol. I could ask them out to do something  but I wouldn't strictly say &quot;want to go for coffee?&quot; type of ask out  that just isn't me :),0
7684, LOUISE!!!!!! Missssssed you :( I am Kelly! How do you think I have been? :D and how is theeeee? :),0

7724, I LOVE YOU TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Thank you for being here tonight :) I really do mean it! I would never have believed how upset I would have been over something that was so badly written.

Im glad he has a friendship with Thomas now :( So anyway  back to point. As yo u know (because I kept updating) I was SO SO SO upset tonight  and you managed to make me feel better :) Its part of being you  and I wish I could come and give you the biggest hug right now :) so  I LOVE YOUUUUU! <3333333,0
7747, What if you roll? Roll up a little then twist? Comprende! Sorted :),0
7748, Ummm  I don't think so lol. Saw Simon Cowell about a month ago. Ermmmm  the nicest people? Well I am obviously biased  but I think I would Say Lily  with Kat close behind :) Lily is SOOOO down to earth  and I Really could imagine myself being good friends with her in real life. As for Kat  she was lovely too  but Kat has a VERY cool exterior  and because she gets a REAL lot of people talking to her  she has a lot to deal with  you know what I mean? When I met Kaya  I didn't actually like her. Both times :( the first time  I was outside the cinema  and Luke  Kat  Lily and Kaya were just going in. I called out &quot;Kat!&quot; and she looked around  really shocked! LOL! Then I spoke to them  and Kaya shouted &quot;come on! The film has already started!&quot; and Lily followed her inside the theater. Luke and Kat were stood there  and we were all just looking at each other  not knowing what to do. I said &quot;don't worry. ITs okay  enjoy your film&quot; and Both Luke and Kat looked at each other  replying &quot;no no no&quot; and walked back over to me :D I LOVED IT! That was SUCH a nice feeling! Knowing they were missing their film to come and talk to me! So anyway  I spoke to Luke first  then I started talking to Kat and Luke went on inside. Then I was saying how much I loved Emily  etc etc etc (crazy fangirl behaviour lol) and she said thanks  did a cute thumbs up thing  I said bye  and she did a cute wave. She was adorable then! Anyway  the second time I met Kaya  it was at the Skins House. She had been in the VIP area upstairs ALL night  and she had just come down  for about 5 minutes. I saw her  and walked over asking for a photo. She was talking to someone  so I just stood there and patiently waited. Then she stopped  and I tapped her on the shoulder. Nothing. So she started talking to someone else. I waited until she finished  and tapped again. Nothing. Then she started talking again  I waited  tapped again. Nothing. So I started saying &quot;kaya?&quot;  nothing. Said it again  nothing :( Then she started to walk away  up some stairs  back into the VIP room  and she was running up pretty fast so I couldn't follow :( Later on  I saw her again  and I asked her to sign my magazine cover. She said yes  and then she had just signed a 'k' and then someone walked into her  causing her to smudge the pen/marker. At this point  she hasn't even signed half her name  but she just said 'sorry' and walked off  leaving me stood there with a magazine with the entire cast's signatures on  and a 'k' over Kaya's photo. I wasn't too impressed if im honest  especially because I wasn't being pushy :( anyway  I did eventually manage to get a quick photo with her  but it was a bit of a job to get there :( Hmm  the cutest? Probably Meg :) She has quite low self asteem actually! When I met her at the filming  she was just sat by herself  watching the filming. Then we went over and started chatting to her  and she was saying how she had been there 10 hours and they hadn't even used her in anything yet :( Then we had a photo with her  and looking back at it  she was like &quot;OMG! I look terrible!&quot; even though she looked adorable :) Then there was when I met her at the house party. She was pretty sweet then too. I think she was a bit nervous actually because in the beginning  she was walking around holding Lukes hand and it was just so sweet to see :) Then  she went outside and was smoking practically the entire night lol. She was a drowned little rat! She was drenched! But still looked adorable :),0
7749, BLOODY HELL!!! Thats insane!!!!!! I hope you are okay now :) Stupid brothers :S Thats why boys suck! Nighttttttt! xxx,0
7750, We should. Hmmm  so Alaska. We decided a cottage right? With a nice warm fire? :P Hmmm  one bedroom? or 2? ;),0

7755, Oh you are? Care to elaborate? :) This Tori? Love with Paris? lol,0
7756, Oh I completely agree! Where did we finish up last? :P,0
7757, No problem sir! You are on my 'ask questions' list :P Just one problem  who are you to ask? ;),0
7758, Oh you do do you? I think you should run around butt naked and borrow your postmans weekly run while prolonging the naked thing :P HAHA! Joke  but all in all...just no :P I don't want memories of the embarrassment that was tonights work :),0
7759, Yeah  I agree. As much as I love Katie being her confident cocky side  it was nice to see her actually fragile for a while. I know she was in Ep 9 of last season  but that was different. She actually felt vunerable  and all I was routing for  is the &quot;Katie fucking Fitch&quot; back :P It will be interesting to see how she is in the next few episodes. Considering she doesn't think she is 'her' anymore  she is having an identity crisis  and I would like to see how that pans out :),0
7760, haha no problem! I don't know if I really (or how) I helped but anyway  I hope I have/will. Send me a message or anything if you need to talk about it :) I know how hard it is  dealing with something like that  so going through it with someone DEFINITELY helps :) So whenever  come to be about it :) cool? xx,0
7761, You called yourself beef? Shame. I always preferred Chicken...,0
7762, Yeah  thats pretty similar to be tbh. By believing in aspects of several religions  we will never end up in the shits ;) ha,0
7763, Of course I will! You don't even need to ask :) If I was there  I would have noticed and done it automatically ;) <33333 How was it? Kickboxing is COOOOOOL! I always wanted to do something like that  but I never got around to it :( Would you protect me if I got attacked? ;),0

7743, Lingerie  boxers  thong  briefs? You know that 'pants' mean something different over here :P,0
7725, Well thank you :)  If its serious  then thanks :D If only it wasn't anonymous  then I could say a nice comment back lol.,0
7726, Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww! Well I wish I was there too :) I haven't had the greatest weekend in history  and I would have loved to have been there :) Probably would have chosen there over anywhere else ever actually! See  feel special :P  I missed you too :( Will you be around to talk soon? <33333,0
7727, Awwwww! I miss you too :( Im going to miss you lots today too  seeing as I have the crapfest of waitressing tonight :'''( Come and save me? Thanks :D Ohhh  and I had another dream last night! Which  I am glad to say you weren't in this one :S It was HORRRRRRRIBLE!!!!!!!!  So  it started off  I was in this really historic City  something like Prague  and I was with my sister. We saw this dog running around  crying out because half of its belly's skin had been ripped off!!! IT had blood ALL over it  but no one could catch the dog to take it to the vets. Anyway  I eventually managed to get it  and my sister (trainee vetinary nurse) was taking a look at him. Then I saw a manager from work  and I don't know how  but I just knew that he had done it. I spoke to him  and he was like &quot;I found this machine  that latches on to a piece of skin  then you pull the handle and it rips it off&quot;. I went HYSTERICAL and was asking what the fuck he thinks he was doing.  So then I ended up at home somehow  and the dog was at the vets Im guessing (i don't know where it went) and then I was reading up about this machine. It said that people who work nights  they used this machine on them (to remove all their skin) so that they weren't able to work in the day  and so outside people could tell the difference between night and day workers (WTF?!?!?!?!) lol. So anyway  I was really freaked out that my manager was going to come and get us (because I lost it on him about the dog) and I told my family  but they didn't really seem to believe me. So time went on  and I was sat in my room  and my sister and mum were randomally led in my bed  really scared. My manager got into the house and eventually attacked my mum. I lost it and grabbed a massive kitchen cake knife thing. I lunged at him  and started attacking his arms to get him to let go of my mum. He did  then he started trying to stab me  all while I kept slicing his arms with this knife. Eventually I went for it  and I slashed his throat!!! He didn't stop  so I had to do it again  a bit deeper. That still didn't stop him  so I started sawing at his neck to cut his head off. Nothing. He was still cutting my arms with his knife thing  so I kicked him to the floor and pushed down all of my weight onto the blade and eventually cut his head clean off!!!! Then he started laughing (even though his head was detached) and said about a bomb that he planted would be going off right about now and we had no time to get out. So we lost. I had a &quot;SHITTTTTT!&quot; moment  and me and my dad were trying to get my family out of the house  then I woke up....So im guessing I would have exploded??? O_O So yeah  im glad you weren't in that one :) Can I have a hug please? That wasn't nice :'''''''(,0

5633, A man walks up to the bar with an ostrich behind him  and as he sits  the bartender asks for their order.r r The man says  &quot;I'll have a beer&quot; and turns to the ostrich. &quot;What's yours?&quot; &quot;I'll have a beer too&quot; says the ostrich.r The bartender pours the beer and says &quot;That will be $3.40 please &quot; and the man reaches into his pocket and pays with the exact change for payment.r r The next day  the man and the ostrich come again  and the man says &quot;I'll have a beer &quot; and the ostrich says &quot;I'll have the same.&quot; Once again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change.r r This became a routine until late one evening  the two enter again. &quot;The usual?&quot; asks the bartender.&quot;Well  it's close to last call  so I'll have a large Scotch&quot; says the man. &quot;Same for me&quot; says the ostrich. &quot;That will be $7.20&quot; says the bartender. Once again the man pulls exact change out of his pocket and places it on the bar.r r The bartender can't hold back his curiosity any longer. &quot;Excuse me  sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?&quot;r r &quot;Well &quot; says the man  &quot;several years ago I was cleaning the attic and I found this old lamp. When I rubbed it a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever needed to pay for anything  I just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money will be there.&quot;r r &quot;That's brilliant!&quot; says the bartender. &quot;Most people would wish for a million dollars or something  but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!&quot;&quot;That's right! Whether it's a gallon of milk  or a Rolls Royce  the exact money is always there &quot; says the man.r r &quot;That's fantastic!&quot; says the bartender. &quot;You are a genius! ... Oh  one other thing sir  what's with the ostrich?&quot;r r The man replies  &quot;Oh  my second wish was for a chick with long legs.&quot;,0

6118, Richard Aldington is probably best known for being one of the first three Imagist poets  along with Ezra Pound and H.D. Around the Fall of 1912 in London  Pound proclaimed himself and his two good friends to be the three original Imagists  and was instrumental in getting the early poems of Aldington and H.D. published in Poetry Magazine (edited by Pound's friend Harriet Monroe in Chicago). The three poets established a set of principles to guide their writings. Pound recorded them in &quot;A Retrospect&quot; (Literary Essays of Ezra Pound. London: Faber &amp; Faber  1954): r r r In the spring or early summer of 1912  'H.D.'  Richard Aldington and myself decided that we were agreed upon the three principles following:r 1. Direct treatment of the 'thing' whether subjective or objective.r 2. To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.r 3. As regarding rhythm: to compose in the sequence of the musical phrase  not in the sequence of a metronome. r r yes i stole it from google so shoot me,0

8769, <33,0
8534, he broke up wit me :),0
8533, yes alot lol,0
8532, WHATTTTTT?,0
8299, Probably 'Exactly'  because I like to agree with people  or sometimes 'but' if im in a contradictory mood :P,0
8300, haha  I think we are both confusing each other :/ Epic fail...lol,0
8301, Hmmmm  I don't like to live by wishing I could have done things differently. It makes you dwell on things  so living for the moment and never looking back sounds good :) You can never be disappointed with what you've done then lol.,0
8302, Umm  make myself a drink. I AM THIRSTY :),0
8303, My toothbrush is blue :),0
8304, Ummm  probably on pairs of shoes that don't fit LOL! I have done it a couple of times  where I may love some  so I decide to buy them  and just hope they fit when I get home. They didn't  and they are sat in my wardrobe waiting to be worn... :P,0
8305, Ummm  &quot;what time is it? Do I have time to go back to bed?&quot; :P lol,0
8306, I only just joined  and it was about 30. But I think its going to go up with all the questions Im getting at the moment ;),0
8307, TO LIVE FAST AND DIE HARD!!!! :D,0
8308, Using up an entire pack of 18 eggs  trying to make me the perfect meringue :),0
8309, Ummmmmm  changing a plug? lol! I don't know  I don't think I have any 'strange' talents as such  or at least none that 'sping' to mind :),0
8310, Ummmmmmm  I don't really think I have one :/,0
8311, Ermmmm  dying having not made an impact during my lifetime :(,0
8312, Girl with one Eye :) DEFINITELY!  Its such an emotional song  and its very deeeeeep! Apparently its about a Lesbian encounter or something LOL!,0
8313, Ummmmmm  I never actually thought about it :/,0
8314, Well 2 days ago (when you asked the question) I can't even remember  But tonight  homemade lasagne and home cooked brownies! :D The parents are away  so im freeeeee. Apart from the sis  but still  I CAN COOK WHATEVER! WOOP!,0
8315, The Earth? :/  I dont have a clue :S,0
8298, I was too mature all through my school/college years  which meant I kind of missed out on that teenage riot thing that a lot of people had :(,0
8316, Do you think Oasis are over rated?,0
8297, OMG! I haven't even thought about it lol. I don't think I really want to go there thanks :),0
8295, ANYTHING!!! As long as I was with you  we could sit on the same pavement everyday and I would still be,0
8278, Ummmm  Lasagne I think :),0
8279, A) Potato B) cup of tea <3 C) GLEEEE <3333333 D) Would you laugh if I said &quot;Don't stop believing&quot; by the Glee cast? Yeah  im obsessed  I know it ;) E) Ummm  Skins interview I think :),0
8280, Hmmmm  probably seeing the Skins cast in Town. it was so unexpected  and I was a tad starstruckkkkkkk O_O,0
8281, A guinea-pig :D,0
8282, Art and Music were my best subjects and worst  was probably languages. Because I was in the top group  I had to do both French and German  and THEY SUCKED :(,0
8283, Ummm  I think I was cooking  and probably on Twitter :),0
8284, Ummmmm  I can't even think that far back :( That means I really really really need a good laugh! Laughing releases tension  and HELL do I need that :(  Make me laugh? Please? :),0
8285, I was always the good girl :) I still am really. Ohh  in class once  in year 4 at primary school (I was about 8) I was chatting in class and the teacher asked me to be quiet  but I carried on talking and she told me off in front of the class  and said she was ringing my mum and asking her to come to the school  to talk about my behavior. I burst out crying  and had to leave the class room. Later on  the parental-teacher chat  consisted of my teacher telling my mum  that she was proud of me for doing something wrong because I was always such a good girl LOL!!!!,0
8286, Hamburger? Orrrrr  Hamger :D I TOTALLY LOVE HAMGER!,0
8287, That I don't love them back. Because I know personally  that given time that could change (I open to people quite easily  not in the literal sense ;) lol) but if I told someone I loved them  some people aren't always going to be nice with their answer. So the second...definitely :),0
8288, Depends on the person.,0
8289, Well the only option? Get in front of my partner and tell them to walk back slowly and run in the other direction while I tried to distract it somehow :S,0
8290, Jump into the middle and try and wizz around it :P If it was gonna hit me anyway  I may as well make the most of it right? ;),0
8291, Hmmm  there is 2 answers to this question :P If you were heavily intoxicated at the time  I would pull back  sit you down and try to sober you up. If you were sober  and everything was all good. Then kiss you back :P,0
8292, I wouldn't even believe you! You are too sweet to ever hurt anyone  but nice try ;),0
8293, Do you mean cheated?,0
8294, Chocolate and Banana! <33333333,0
8296, Getting hurt  or my heart ripped out. I trust people  and probably give my love away too easily  which means in return  it makes you more prone to the pain of rejection or getting hurt :(,0
8317, I was REALLY angry one time  with my parents  and I snapped it in half and threw it into the garden.... :P Then I ran outside to go and find it  and I cried because it was broken LOL!,0
8318, SESAME STREET BUBBLE BATH when I was about 16!!! DEAR GOD :(,0
8319, SALT N VINEGAR! :D,0
8342, Bristol  England :) Southmead Hospital to be precise :),0
8343, Next to Donald Duck...in the pizza place across the road from the waterski lake.,0
8344, my neck  my back and.....my.....head? lol. Do you massage any other parts? lol,0
8345, Hmmm  good question. I don't think I have really been compared. Once though  I was making dinner or a drink or something in the kitchen  and I noticed my dad staring at me from the side. I was like &quot;Dad  what?&quot; &quot;Ohh  nothing. You just REALLY looked like that red headed girl from skins then&quot; Emily?&quot; &quot;yeah  thats the one&quot; &quot;really?! Nahhhhhh&quot; &quot;you did. Just the angle and the hair&quot; &quot;Ohh  coool&quot; :D lol,0
8346, Your sight  because without it  life may be more anticipated  but it would be too scary not to be able to see anything :S,0
8347, HAHAHA!!!! I have NEVER even thought about that :S Ummm  a cherry? Strawberry? Sweet and goes with everything? lol,0
8348, I LOVEEEEEEE Horror films!!!! I love the feeling of tension and suspense of them  and watching a story unfold is just amazing <3333 Also  to watch it with your partner  its an excuse to cuddle up  right? ;),0
8349, I think Love is  because if you are angry at someone  you can surpass that  because you still love them. So all in all  I think love tops all :),0
8350, Probably something by Patrick Park. He is pretty depressing  even though I do love his music :D Rock bottom? Ohhh yessss I have. Steal trying to deal with that :(,0
8351, Hmmm  If you asked me this question a year ago  then I would have said &quot;The Descent&quot;  hands down! It was a horror film  but it had so many aspects of those traditional horror films  it wasn't just relying on blood and gore to bring the viewers in (obviously it had that too)  but it was more than the recent horror that is being made...So anyway  I loved it until the second one came out  and it just didn't flow as well as the first  and it didn't make the plot go anywhere. If anything  it went slightly backwards  only because it cleared up things from the first one  that would have been nice left to the imagination... :(,0
8352, Probably 'The Writer' by a certain Miss Goulding :D It's just beautiful!!! Have you heard it?,0
8353, The one where you said about visiting England  how you want to come to Brighton or Bristol  depending on the time because there is someone you wanted to meet. That made me awwwww and really put a smile on my face for quite a while. So thank you ! <33333,0
8354, Whichever I pick up first  which usually turns out to be the left :),0
8355, It changes  and its usually the song that im addicted to  whatever that may be. At the moment  its Ellie Goulding  Black and Gold. Surprise surprise :P,0
8356, St Trinians :P I wanted to watch it for AGES  and I finally watched it the other day with my parents  and its not that great is it? I thought it was too stupid :S Like  I know it was a comedy but I didn't think it was a stupid slapstick film lol!,0
8357, Well  don't laugh  but I can't even remember the name of it! It was a story of a dragon  who had no friends because he kept doing things wrong and pissing them off. I LOVED it  and I remember when I got too old for it  I still kept it by my bed as a security blanket thing. Gahhh  what was it called?! He was like  an orangey tall dragon thing  and he was really sweet :),0
8358, Which every way you want it to my darling. You can talk to them in space  did you know that? They listen and point wherever you wanted. They are like children  only nice :P,0
8341, Staying home :( I have to leave it here and get the bus/train everywhere :'( It costs me about u00a350 in petrol to brighton and back  so about the same price as the train :(,0
8340, Where do you want to walk to? That's where we will go :),0
8339, Hmmmm...I would have to say the Disney character breakfast Buffet (when I was like 9) at my hotel in Florida :),0
8338, It was predetermined before the rhyme was written...,0
8320, I don't really have a 'type'. I would say someone shorter than me  and I do love blonde hair and blue eyes  but I wouldn't class them as my type. Its anyone really. Depends on their personality too :),0
8321, Probably the 2nd one. I liked the storyline that it was a sort of quest  rather than just a room kind of thing. How about you?,0
8322, Hmmmm  I remember watching something and it was HILARIOUS! But I can't remember what it was :( It was a long time ago  and I was in stitches. Ummmmmm  It was some old retro type of movie  but its gone lol. Other than that  Airplane is pretty funny  and Without a Paddle (but I haven't seen it in ages). I like shows like Punk'd too  but thats not a movie is it? :P,0
8323, Ummm  probably online actually. It wasn't great lol. I kind of wish I hadn't because it made things awkward :(,0
8324, Well I keep putting it off lol. I need to go into the hairdressers and they are going to take a small cutting of my hair  then try the bleaching process to see how many times it needs bleaching to get it a nice blonde colour. Then  once they can see it withstands the process without breaking off (SCARY) then they will allow me to bleach it :) Im going to have to do it about 3/4 times  so you can imagine how bad thats going to be for my hair :( Anyway  Im probably going to go into the hair dressers on wednesday to get a small bit cut off :),0
8325, Knowing I have no work  a lie in in the morning  a night of relax and peace ahead of me  and an evening with my girlfriend (if I had one) lol.,0
8326, I was in school  and I didn't really find out. It found me out  and I was about 15 when I fully realised :),0
8327, Its never...,0
8277, The food/ice-cube/water fight in my restaurant tonight :),0
8328, 28th July :),0
8330, Well I had a HORRIBLE DREAM last night  but it was about work  so does that count? :P I dreamt that everyone (staff wise) was sent home because it was quiet  so it was just me and my manager in the restaurant (like it has been for the last couple of shifts I have worked). We suddenly had this MAD rush of people through the door  and it got really busy. Thing is  I was the only member of staff on  and my manager wasn't turning anyone away  so I was running the whole restaurant by myself. I think I was about to faint in my dream  because of the stress of everyone yelling at me for something to do  that I woke up lol. Then I fell back to sleep rather quickly and went back into it :'( Anywayyy...that doesn't count I take it :P  Well I argue with my family a lot  and I don't really get on with my father. So  we are ALWAYS arguing over things  and it really gets me down. We had a massive argument on tuesday night about something (he treats my sister differently  better  even though she is the one that causes all the trouble). This argument got VERY heated  and I ended up being stuck in my room ALL night  completely starving and thirsty but I wasn't going out to face him lol.,0
8331, HAHA! Actually no. I don't think anything went through my mind except for  &quot;OH MY SHIT!&quot;. I actually have never imagined Lily naked  Im a decent person you see ;) don't do that :P,0
8332, Dolphin Trainer! I wanted to be one SOOOOOOO BADLY!!!,0
8333, Tuesday 16th :),0
8334, To be honest  I don't really mind where I go  it all depends on who I go there with. I do like going to clubs though  to let loose. But I do have to be in the mood.  Other than that  shopping  movies  friends house  my house (:P)  walks  random places etc etc etc :),0
8335, Oils no longer have the same meaning ;) Its totally been changed. Oils  no longer can be considered clean...,0
8336, Asleep cuddled up with 'Emily Fitch' ;) lol,0
8337, You mean in my lifetime? TOO many places :S Toured most of America  France  Loads of places in Spain  Italy  Most of the UK at some point  Cyprus  Turkey  Prague  ummmmm  Can't think of anywhere else at the moment. They will probably pop up later :),0
8329, Because if the injection didn't work  and they actually survived. What would happen if they caught something like aids from the needle? The injector person would then get into a tad bit of trouble :P,0
8359, True love with a guarantee of heart break. Its better to have loved and lost  than to never have loved at all right? Even though  losing them in the end  is really fucking painful  but the moments shared with them  for me  really out do it :),0
8276, You  being so sweet :),0
8274, Probably the Skins Novel lol.  Hmm  I liked parts of it  and other parts I didn't. I don't think it was written that well  well of course it was if it was just a novel about random people  but for the storyline of Skins  I think it was pretty out of character :( I like reading  but I get distracted pretty easily  so if Im enjoying it  I would continue to read  whereas if its hard to 'get into' then I probably wouldn't even finish it lol.,0
8214, Probably LA. It was a 14 hour flight from home  and I hate flying so it was HORRRRRRRRRIBLE :'(,0
8215, Probably their eyes. Thats what you look at when you talk to someone  and you can tell a lot about a person from looking into their eyes. Not what is going on with them and their life history  of course not  but you can get a vibe of 'what that person is like' if that makes sense? sometimes you are wrong  but hey  its the best judge of character when looking at someone :),0
8216, I can imagine? Well happily married  perfect job  perfect kids  perfect life :D Whatever 'perfect' is :D (and no im not Katie :P),0
8217, Losing all the people who I love  any form of communication with the world. Being paralyzed and unable to speak  all of the above :'(,0
8218, Well  I remember once  when we had not long been back from seeing &quot;The Grudge&quot; in the cinema  and I had an idea to freak my mum out. So  the next day  I got down this polystyrene head thing that I had  drew eyes on it with eyeliner  and pulled out this fake black wig I had from a fancy dress thing and dressed the wig with it. I then pulled out a floaty white dress thing that I had in my wardrobe  and kind of draped it over the head  making it look like a person. I then hung the head up  in a really odd angle in my parents cupboard under the stairs. When my mum came home  I called her and asked her to get me a bottle of drink from the cupboard  and she said yes. Me and my dad were waiting for the scream  and she returned with the bottle of drink  having not made a sound. Me and my dad were stunned  and asked her if she had seen &quot;it&quot;. &quot;Seen what?&quot; she replied....total and utter fail....lol,0
8219, Well  it may not be that stupid  but I will always remember it. All through school  I was always the good girl who never got into trouble. I remember during secondary school  in year 8 (which is about age 11/12) I was on a lunch break and I and all my friends bought a plate of chips for dinner. We were sat eating them in the cafeteria  and people started throwing their chips at us  so my friends started throwing them back  but I refused to join in because I didn't want to get into trouble. Anyway  after much persuasion from my friends  I decided to throw ONE chip to get them off my back. I did  and guess what happened? The teacher saw me  NO ONE else  just me  and I got sent to detention for a week. I was so pissed! lol! Everyone found it funny bar me. Not good...lol,0
8220, Ummmm  Im not really a difficult or 'out there' kind of person  but lets think  there must be something... ........... ........... .......... Nope  can't think of anything. I guess im just not that stupid ;),0
8221, Well  once I took MDMA once and  well  umm  I was out of it I suppose  and I went to bed with a random bloke! LOL! Im pretty sure nothing happened but still  for me  that is rather crazy :S Probably why I have never done it since lol.,0
8222, Italian! Without doubt!!! Best foooood! I don't really like chinese  japanese  indian  thai etc etc lol. So im pretty fussy when it comes to food types :P,0
8223, Ermmmmm  I don't think I have one lol. Probably eyes? But it depends on how my make-up looks :P My eyes look PURE GREEEEEEEN in the daylight  but at night. They look boring lol!,0
8224, I don't actually day dream  so I can't really answer that :),0
8225, Loosing the ones that I love  and dying alone or unhappy :(,0
8226, pet peeve? What the hell is a pet peeve?! lol,0
8227, Skinssssssss collage of loads of Emily pictures XD,0
8228, I think its different for each person  but the definition of happiness for me  would be to start a family  to provide for my family  see them all go far in life  have the greatest relationship with my parents  a great career  and most of all  the root of happiness  find love :),0
8229, &quot;Time for Coffee?&quot; I posted it on Livejournal and Fanfiction if you are interested :),0
8230, Cheddar :)  Nice and simple would do me  I don't need anything fancy :),0
8213, No idea  and thats too many 'e's and 's's to even bare thinking about :) Diddums...,0
8231, haha  random. Ummm  'There'? lol,0
8212, POUNDS!!! GBP BABY!  lol,0
8210, I think getting into this Film School on Friday is definitely up there! Oh  also getting my work entered into a big art museum thing once by my art teacher (without%,0
8193, No clue :/,0
8194, Some religious correction for something? :S,0
8195, Ummm  like a strawberry kind of cherry scent :),0
8196, You  but im sure you know that already. Anything where I can see someone has gone out of their way to either talk to me  do something for me. But all in all  when someone has done something really really special  that took so much effort  and it was all for me  I really really melt <3,0
8197, I have no idea :/ and Im too exhausted right now to even think about it :S Ummm  you mean my experience or others? Maybe something like  being serious and never letting loose may get you a good job  but it's not a way to enjoy life.,0
8198, Probably my cousin  because she is the person who I get on with the best outside of the people that I live with.,0
8199, CHOCOLATE!!! Anything with Chocolate in  and I just dieeeeee! Milk or white though  no dark stuff :S,0
8200, Phone  Car keys  house keys  money  jewellery and clothing ;),0
8201, Dunno. You get high?,0
8202, Ummmmmm  I think it was the Kat/Meg one. The one where I was pestering Meg for an autograph  and Kat burst out crying.  Kat was trying to explain  but Meg pulled her away. All she said was &quot;boyfriend..&quot; lol. Then they went into a premiere of something  and I was left stood there  by my lonesome of the shopping mall...then I lost my car in the car park. It was all very random :/,0
8203, hmmm  you end up chasing after it? :/,0
8204, Of course. Its your little area of &quot;special talk&quot;,0
8205, I would like to ask myself the same question... :/,0
8206, I don't know if I would ever leave one  but being remembered for doing something great  that would be awesome :D It doesn't even have to be big  just something that people would respect you for in years to come :),0
8207, I think life is beautiful. In general. Everything about it  where we came from  how we were created  if it was indeed a miracle or a scientific explosion. I think there is inspiration to find in everything. Its not limited to a certain flower or building  its in everything around us  people  surroundings  flowers. Its just about how you see it :),0
8208, What's harder? DEFINITELY telling someone else. Only because  if someone is telling you how they feel  at least you have the control of the situation  and you can control how you react. However  if you are telling someone you love them  you have completely put yourself out there  and have no input on where the conversation goes next. Its all about having the control of the situation  and even if you don't feel the same  at least you aren't putting your heart on the line :),0
8209, I do have a bedside table indeed. Its a black wooden effect thing  and I have a small lamp  my remote controls  a bottle of perfume  my phone (when I sleep) and a coaster (for a drink) :),0
8211, Hmmmmmmmmmmmm  my car? It may be boring to you  but I LOVEEEE IT! Its a new Beetle cabriolet  in metallic light silver  and I have birds and flowers down the sides of it. It has a black leather trip  and is plain gorgeous :D <33333333 lol!,0
8232, Hmmmm  if I said chocolate would you think &quot;How original&quot; and pull a sarcastic face? lol,0
8233, On me  or in general? I think probably blonde for both. I just love blonde hair  but only when it is looked after properly. Those people that constantly straighten and mess about with their hair  don't deserve to even have hair :P All hair colours are beautiful  but it completely depends on the person :) Im not so into wacky colours  eg mixes of pink  purple  green  blue etc. But Natural tones  definitely :) With the exception of bright red  because that is still a natural colour  just exaggerated a little :P,0
8234, Has to be pasta :) Definitely. Its so versitile! You can do so many things with it  and although it doesn't necessarily have much taste  its the texture I really like :),0
8257, When I see that someone I care about has gone out of their way to do something for me (with the intention of making me happy in some way)  and by doing it out of their own will. Thats the best feeling in the world :) Doesn't have to be much. Just unexpected :D,0
8258, Im not listening to any music actually. The Jonathon Ross Chat Show is on the TV though  and Lady Gaga was performing  so technically Brown Eyes by Lady Gaga :),0
8259, I would like to revisit LA  in California  just because I wen't there with my family a couple of years ago  but I have ALWAYS wanted to check out the gay scene there LOL! Its lame  but we went on a tour  and they were saying how 'West Hollywood' is the gay part  and I would have liked to have checked that out  by myself  you know? Not with my family around  peering over my shoulder every second lol.,0
8260, Ummm  probably New Jersey. No reasons in particular ;);),0
8261, Toronto  Canada :) There is someone special there I would really like to meet :D,0
8262, Oh yeah  thats grossssss! Okay  I have something that REALLY grosses me out  but its kind of weird :P lol!  Well when I go to bed  I have to have clean feet lol. I mean  not like  I have to actually scrub them before I get into bed  but I hate the thought of having any dust or anything (if I have been walking around bare foot) on the bottom of my feet while getting into bed. I have to wear a pair of socks  then take them off just before im getting into bed  without letting my feet then touch the floor. Yeah  told you it was weird :P,0
8263, Caude Michel &quot;Colour Protect&quot; Shampoo :),0
8264, THE WRITER BY ELLIE GOULDING!!  When the chorus approaches  I just die <333333,0
8265, Hmmmm  well I don't have a clue! LOL! When I listen to songs  I don't really tend to listen to the words too much :P Its more the melody  sooooo  how about I just describe how I feel in the morning  and you can work out a song  yeah? :D Sooo  when I wake up. Usually I don't get enough sleep  so lets just say im not the best morning person there is lol. I like my sleep  and I do sort of  want to never get out of bed :P So  once im actually out of bed  I go into the kitchen and make a drink  pretty pronto. Then I usually drink it  sat in front of the TV. Thats my morning ritual lol. Its not the most energetic of wake-ups  but there again  sleepless nights :P,0
8266, I dont know  something that fits the moment and what happens at the wedding (eg  how you get married) :),0
8267, Can I cheat and say musical ringtones? ;),0
8268, Ummm  did I miss something? lol,0
8269, 6:07pm,0
8270, Hmmm  I don't have a clue! LOL! Something spontaneous or unexpected?  Something that turns me off  someone not respecting me  or my feelings towards something :(,0
8271, Probably R&amp;B. Only because its usually about men wanting to sleep with women  and or vice versa  and it DOES MY HEAD IT!!!  Eg  AKON!!!! Grrrrrr. lol,0
8272, The fact that its possible for someone to actually be so sweet :D I mean  you really are  and its shocked me that I am the one to discover it!!!! <3!,0
8273, HAHA! When did I say I was attracted to you ;) You're cute  but you know that right? :),0
8256, Hmmm  I think its just fancy talk from the white house if im honest...,0
8255, Sleeeeeeepy mood :(,0
8254, I ended up with Vanilla  but I did do something with it  not just eat vanilla :) My favourite has got to be the mixed exotic kinds. Aka strawberry with pieces  or cookies and cream  and mint choc chip. Good choice by the way ;) IT depends what mood im in :) Love a bit of strawberry though! <333333,0
8253, Well I would LOVE to direct Horror films ideally. Just because they aren't so much about the writing  but more about the direction of the film. You need to think about so many more things  eg cinematography (lighting)  angles  editing. Everything is so much more creative than your standard Rom Com. Its more interesting and much more of a challenge to do it successfully :),0
8235, CHEESECAKE!!! Without doubt!!! I don't love ice-cream that much  and im not really a hot desert person. But cheesecake  I could eat all day! LOL! Toffee or strawberry XD YUMMM! I want some now :(,0
8236, I don't really eat Jam  except on rice pudding. Ummmm  cherry?,0
8237, Probably sketching :) But I have to be in the mood for it. If not  then Twitter or lately  formsprint ;) Orrrr  playing the drums. But I only have time slots for that (for obvious reasons) so if im not in the mood  I wont play  and if im in the mood but its too late  I can't play :(,0
8238, I never have thought about it  I would say Italy. For some random reason  I think it has a ring to it :),0
8239, OMG! Belgium seashells!! They are THE chocolate XD,0
8240, Kelly Annabel Blake. But schhhhhh  I don't like anyone to know my middle name :P,0
8241, Hmmmmmmmmm  guilty pleasure. Probably watching movies and TV shows with lesbian subplots (LOL). Only because they are extremely cute (usually) and well  interesting...ahem...next question...,0
8242, It sounds lame  but the thing that springs to mind  was the filming of the Skins opening sequence :) I LOVED IT! Not just because it was Skins  but the whole atmosphere of filming  it was amazing!,0
8275, The Descent Part 2 I think. I haven't been there in a while. It wasn't that great  it was a bit like an extension of the first one and didn't seem to go anywhere :(,0
8243, Ummmmm  180??,0
8245, I HATEEEE it when people say 'Fanny' or 'fart' (something to do with the f's lol). But I reallllly cannot stand them :S EUGH! haha,0
8246, Im naturally blonde :) Not bleached blonde  but a sandy kind of natural tone :),0
8247, Well I would like it to be a surprise. Either way  something unexpected you know? Something to remember  so however it was  it would be remembered as 'perfect' and special :D,0
8248, I have been baptized so technically I am a christian  but I don't really have any beliefs. I am open minded I guess you could say about things. The one thing I hate about religion  is that is causes too many war. If religion is all about loving one another  why does everyone have to fight? :(,0
8249, Loosing the people that I love... I will never forget being told that my grandparents had passed away. It was horrific :'(,0
8250, My style? You mean with hair  make-up  clothing etc? Shall I answer all? lol So hair style  i'm not one of those people who like their hair to look perfect all the time. On occasion  yeah I like to style it but im not anal about it being perfect. I absolutely LOVE messy hair  so I use the natural wave thats in my hair  to create a messy and  kind of bed-head look. I use more hairspray than I probably should  but I like the end effect :) My make-up style  I prefer a natural make-up look for daytime  for example a little eyeliner and gold tone eye shadows. For evening or clubs (depending on my clothing) I LOVE a black smokey eye look (only when its done properly) so I might do something with dark eyeshadows and black makeup  but keep a natural base and nude lips. My clothing...well...do you have a year? lol I don't really go by what things say in magazines or in the fashion world at all. I like to wear what I want  and I don't give a shit if anyone else doesn't like it. I suppose in Skins sense (to refer it to someone) I wear a lot of Effy kind of inspired clothes (slashes  white/black  chains etc) but I like to mix it with different prints and/or colours. Imagine a mix of Effy  Naomi and Emily  and you have my kind of style lol. I once wore my satin dressing gown out as a jacket LOL! It was to a Skins House Party actually  and its blue and a floral pattern  you may have seen it :) So all in all  fuck other people  look how you want to look :),0
8251, Leo the lion....RAWRRRRRRR...,0
8252, Well my first job (when I was 13) was a paper round. I had to deliver something like 300 newspapers a week  and they were weekly so it all had to be done on one night :S I didn't love that! Then when I was 15  I quit and got myself a job at the local charity shop. It only paid u00a33.50 an hour  but I was only 15 :) Then at 16  I went to a retail clothing shop for a year  it got crap  so I moved to another one (H&amp;M  you might have heard of it) then a year later  I went to TGI fridays  and I have been there for 2 years :) Part time though  while I was at college and stuff :),0
8244, Well im a sucker for someone who can be original. Like  say just getting a take away and going somewhere really nice  sitting under the stars eating it. I think my perfect date would involve a beach walk during sunset (has to be a warm night) then sitting down with a picnic under the stars watching the sun finally set. Dreamy much! LOL,0
8886, why not? (;,0
8360, Too little light :) Its not so harsh :) Also  when things are a little darker  then you can be a little more anticipated :) Plus its a lot more romantic :),0
8362, Ummm  the UK? I dont even know who is in it :S Thats how much im into my sport. Im a bad fan :( lol,0
8469, Chicken breast  Salad Cream and salad! YUMMMMMMMY :D,0
8470, I don't want to blow anyone up :( Thats murderrrrr  plus  the tremor and flames from the explosion would probably hurt innocent people. Best to stay away from the button and  freeze it? :/ lol,0
8471, The time of birth. Then I can pop out and yell at my parents for having my sister first :) lol,0
8472, No one is allowed to live there unless they look colourful :),0
8473, Oh but I am.,0
8474, I dont think its really feasable. Someone has been watching too much of the L Word...,0
8475, List????! I KNOW WHO YOU AREEEEEE!!!! ;);),0
8476, I dooooo :'( well  good  but also scary :S It has a really good rep though  so  going to be worth it :),0
8477, I doubt it. I might watch it online  but that doesn't class as &quot;going to watch&quot; its staying to watch :),0
8478, Have I? I actually have one Dollar  and its a really cool tracking thing on it  so I kept it in my purse :P,0
8479, Hmm  good question. I would say a TV-Documentary exploring the views on Homophobia in the 21st century.,0
8480, It depends. First on how Skint I was  and second  if there was anyone else about. If there was no one there  whats the point of handing it it? I may as well give it a use  and take it to my local exchange currency place  and get back some money :) DRINKS ARE ON ME :D,0
8481, Awwww  can I put it back together again? Who's heart did I melt? Maybe you melt mine ;),0
8482, Awwwwww! I do? Well you are one God damn special person  I can't go without tweeting you :D <333,0
8483, Awwwwww <33333 Thank you! That was sweet XD! And as do you :D,0
8484, Yes :( Because everyone wants it to be perfect and with the right person yeah? Well most people  and how it ended  was badly. So yeah  I regret it :(,0
8485, I think I really should ;) Hmmm  I don't think I would make it though  then I would end up in the middle of nowhere with no computer and be all lost :'( I shall wait  and kidnap you when its going to be special ;) <3,0
8468, Well for me  true love comprises of Trust. You can never let yourself love someone fully if you don't trust them. So  Love :),0
8486, Ermmmm  I don't think I have actually. BUT  anything with chocolate is FINEEEEEE WITH ME :D,0
8467, HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Now that you say it  I totally agree!!! I had never thought of it before  but now that you say it  WHAT THE HELL?! lol! I guess it must have to have an age limit if there were...lumps? lol,0
8465, haha! These are funny :P Well &quot;whelmed&quot; for some reason makes me think of being slapped or something :S I don't know why  just does. Probably a good thing then right? :),0
8448, Oh yeah? Was that in school? They certainly know how to cheer you guys up ;) lol,0
8449, HAHA! Who knows? ;););),0
8450, I hope I don't decide to watch this show one day. I will be screwed...,0
8451, Im a giver  definitely! I like to please other people  and when I see someone else's face light up at something I have done  its just the best feeling!!!! <33333 BUT  to receive is also an important part of the relationship. I think  personally its about finding a balance of both  but Im definitely a giver :),0
8452, HAHA! Thats rather high ;) I love how its not &quot;between 8 and 9&quot; or &quot;hmm  perhaps 8.5&quot; nooo  its 8.2! HA! Love it :D I do yes  its called &quot;Nights in Spain&quot; Ever read it? I think I bookmarked it  bear with me :),0
8453, No problem :))) x,0
8454, I was just thinking about getting my stone out  fancy grabbing me some chippings to use for a fire? Getting cold again...,0
8455, WTF?! Thats insannnnnnne!!!! That is one odd dog :/ Was your face okay? Like  no scarring or anything?,0
8456, brap brap *head enlarges*,0
8457, Glad to hear it ;),0
8458, Oh yeah? Its cold though right? I have only been there in the summer  twice  but its still been rather cold :S,0
8459, haha! How about Jaffa rolls? That has a nice ring to it :) Although  didn't they do some roll type thing once? :/,0
8460, OH GOD YES!!! Well  they suck  or they are religious. I have no 'beef' with anyone who doesnt watch it because they are religious  because I could see issues there lol! So  you a fan of anyone in general? aka  a certain couple? ;);) lol,0
8461, I do? Well thank you :D You amuse me too :) In a good way obviously :D,0
8462, I would probably tell people  only to make it easier on the ones that I love and not having to tell people about my death. I would want everyone to be around them and there for them  just incase they morn ;) I WOULD BE TERRIFIED! Umm  what I would do? I don't know to be honest  everything and anything that I have always wanted to? Go traveling  go mad I suppose :) Horrible thought :S,0
8463, Can I call &quot;999&quot; and say &quot;GET YOUR ARSE UP HERE AND FROST US OFF!!! Thanks...&quot;,0
8464, haha  well the chicken and the egg  who actually cares? THIS IS MUCH MORE INTERESTING :),0
8466, Thank you :D <33333,0
8487, These questions are goooood :) So  I would say  Perhaps the Jackson? But only if he would appreciate it and leave me millions in his will ;) MWAH HA HA HA HA...,0
8488, Of course.,0
8489, I will have to wait until my year at Brighton is up  after that  im there! :D,0

8493, Im really not :P NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT!! &quot;la la la la la&quot; *drowns out any excuse to talk over me* ;) haha! My voice sounds horrible and I look horrible  Im rambling  I look like an IDIOT. All in all  it didn't go very well :P,0
8494, That doesn't suck for me! You keep my mind occupied and off other things that are BADDDDDDDDDDD :D,0
8495, I didn't. But its nice to clear that up ;) lol!,0
8496, Awwwwwwww! Thank you! But not if you added enough chocolate ;) HAHA! You are so incredibly sweet  imagine us both together! Talk about a sugar rush :P <3,0
8497, Ummmm  indescribable ;) Nahhh  twisting?,0
8447, hmm  Pasta and salt. Sounds incredibly lovely :/ I shall eat around the pasta at the edges then  and post the rest to you. Cool?,0
8498, HAHA! Yeah  we start college at 16  and then finish at 18  to go to university and usually come out about 21/22 with your degree depending on what you major in. Most degrees are 3 years  but if you wanted to be a Vet or a Doctor or a Surgeon etc  its about 6/7 years. Completely depends on the course :) The course im doing in september  basically gives me the equivilent of a degree  but in one year. Then I have the access to continue for another year  (making it a total of 2) to gain a masters in motion picture production  and the area I specialised in. So  Film School can definitely be a quicker route through education  but it is a lot more intense.,0
8500, I actually prefer dogs  but I only have cats because of my sister. She took on 2 kittens  and took in 2 from rescues. I prefer Dogs  but they are much more work than cats are. Besides  Cats a cleaner :P,0
8501, You mean online or in person? I don't know  I can't really think :/ Determine friend :),0
8502, Tell me about it! :S,0
8503, Hmmm  I don't think I really have enemies as such. People I don't wish to communicate with  I don't. Simple as :) So  me talking to you  it means I would at least like you. GO YOU :D,0

8361, You wouldn't let me down  perhaps not. But who's to say that you wouldn't lie me down...?,0
8446, A biscuit? Ummm  yeah :) A nice one though! XD,0
8444, Of course I would! :) You're not far from New York right? I think I should visit  and we both go to New York together :) A lot of traveling America I don't like to do because of long plane journeys but New York is about 7 hours going and 5.5 coming back  so thats GOOOOOD! :D  You're about an hour away from New York right? I may have googled it ;) lol,0
8384, HAHA! I think someone should devise a thing where both are built in one. Do you reckon? Hmmm  might be onto something there  there could be money in this ;),0
8385, I would totally never buy a boned fillet if that was the case.. I can see the headlines now &quot;Anyone for chicken bone? Anyone for chicken bone? Oh yes  and the little bit of meat that surrounds it...&quot;,0
8386, De de de dahh de doooo *pretends I am not asked a question that stumps me* la la le loooo...,0
8387, I am? :/,0
8388, My teeth are awesome? You think? Or was that sarcasm? lol Thanks  I just maintain them  and take regular visits to the dentist. Up to now (touch wood)  I have never had any treatment or fillings in my teeth  so I must be doing something right :),0
8389, I would have liked to  but stupid bad ass meeting in work  rather early I might add :'( WHY AREN'T YOU?! :P lol,0
8390, My phone never rings :S If you mean today  I was preoccupied :P,0
8391, Because it draws the spectator in....then...&quot;RARRRRRR! GOT YOU&quot; &quot;...bollocks...&quot; You have to do whatever they say now. You are under their spell. Kind of like a prostitute  but no sex or money...,0
8392, Thats for off road racing  aka track racing :P Well I dunno  perhaps? Or its a guide for your enemies? &quot;You hate them this much  hit them at this speed...&quot; etc ;),0
8393, Well  I for one  never really feel that hungry when I wake up. I sleep at odd times (because of my insomnia) so when I get up  I normally wait until about 2ish and have a bit of toast which lasts me for breakfast and lunch. Here's my theory. When you get hungry  if you don't actually eat anything  after a while you start to go past it  and I for one  lose my appetite altogether. So here's my thinking. You are asleep overnight  thus losing your appetite whist you are asleep  then waking up having gone past it  and are no longer hunger? What do you think?,0
8394, Because thats just plain greedy!!! If you are given the cake  thats one out of 2. If there is no one else there  then fine  you can eat it too. If someone else is there though  tough shit. You had your half  now you need to let someone else eat it :P,0
8395, &quot;getting your dog fixed&quot;? I haven't even heard that before lol.,0
8396, HAHAHAHAHA!!!! I think you should ask that to Obama  if he doesn't have a good enough reason  he may post it in his speeches ;),0
8397, Cure for boredom :) Its not like anyone is really interested  but hey :),0
8398, I don't hate hockey  at all  I just can't stay watching that little puck bounce about when I keep loosing it. It's all about finding the right distractions :P,0
8399, Formspring  yeah I do love the anonymity of it. You can ask someone something  without actually asking them directly. So  it can save that awkward &quot;Why?&quot; moment that everyone dreads :P Formspring makes you question things  and I don't just mean that in the literal sense  it makes you question things about yourself  and as a result  you can find out things you didn't even know were there. Its informing :),0
8400, Because its contained inside a bottle? There is no oxygen getting to it? Ermmmmm  dunno lol. Its cute  continue :),0
8383, Because thats how you win. Didn't you know? They call it softball to attract all the girls  then you hit them in the head  and BINGO! You have a free court ;),0
8401, Its a trick. If you can't spell in  FAILLL>>> Into &quot;special needs&quot; class at school  while the rest of the teachers smoke weed...lol,0
8382, I think they come from all over the chickens body. Head  legs  claws  eyes  beak  and perhaps a tiny bit of the breast?  Altogether  IT TASTES GOOOOD ;) Only joking  I don't like fast food  probably because there isn't enough chicken heads in there. Just saying...,0
8380, At the moment  its you :P I think  in time  if they want to give themselves away  then they are welcome to. But for the moment  I shall not reveal the mystery ;),0
8363, Jimmy Carr ;);),0
8364, Kathryn? :/,0
8365, I actually dont really aspire to be anyone. I think everyone is different  and you can want to do something that someone else has done  but if you aspire to actually be them  you are always going to be disappointed :),0
8366, Who do I ship? If I told people  that would be like letting people on board for free. Need to pay for your tickets :P,0
8367, Who? You mean why? No clue :S,0
8368, I don't think I can answer that :/,0
8369, Now that would be telling ;) haha,0
8370, Yay indeedo! Can I be boring and say I don't have a clue? lol. Who would you think I resemble? :) Personality wise  I can't really say either  only because I don't think celebrities are in the spotlight enough to see their true personalities. A bit of a crap question to ask you wasn't it really? :(,0
8371, My dad did actually.  My mum named my sister  Charlotte so it was my dad's turn to name me. If they went with my mums choice  I would have been called 'Emily'. Quite funny considering I AM EMILY when it comes to Skins and relating to her character lol :P,0
8372, Carla Price...precisley 2 hours ago ;),0
8373, ERmmm  probably a friend :),0
8374, Ermmm well the phone just rang and it was those stupid automatic call things &quot;Are you aware that over 5 million people in Britain every year pay more for their gas prices-&quot; &quot;-BEEEP!&quot; Hang up lol. They do my head in! Why do people constantly feel the need to ring you up and put you onto a machine the other end? Thats what a phone is for :S Its different if you ring them and get a machine  but the other way around? Psssssh! Its like my voicemail calling you :S,0
8375, probably Drew Barrymore  only because she comes across very much as the sweet and innocent girl  which a shy side  a geeky side and a dorky idiot. Which I think I have elements of :/,0
8376, Singing wise  there isnt even a choice. I think Beyonce is very natural looking  but I would say  personally  Taylor Swift. Beyonce is the GOD of singing voices :),0
8377, You ;);),0
8378, Without doubt  Lily Loveless,0
8379, Ummmm  no idea :S,0
8381, Why?! You need me to answer that?! Once you sort out your sexuality (and Louise for that matter) you both are totally on ;),0
8402, HAHAHAHA! Wow! I love you for this comment! Thats hilarious! <3333,0
8403, Because Charlie is also short for charlotte  and time for a story I think...  Once upon a time  there was a young girl called Charlotte. She was a pretty little girl  and everyone loved her. only one problem is  she had a great love for sports and all things male. She came out to her parents as being gay  and they wouldn't tolerate such a thing! So  they sent her to the nearby hospital and attached...pieces  and removed....bits.  She comes out  or is it still a she? His parents decided to cure the 'gay' issue  by changing her into a boy. Her former name  Charlotte had to be changed  and by rule of easiness  they changed it to Charles  so her former nickname would still be of use (they didn't want to change her name again  costing them more by deed poll). Charlie lived happily ever after  marrying the woman of his dreams... The end :),0
8404, Hmmm  I had SO many questions if &quot;turning on&quot; wasn't to do with Alarm Clocks. But I think you have me there...such a shame ;),0
8427, Depends on the person  I can see where you are going with this ;),0
8428, LOL!!! Depends if the 16 year old was present IF I were to do MDMA :P,0
8429, Ummm no. Talk about Potassium overload :S,0
8430, It depends on the person. If it was my enemy who just murdered my best friend...im staying put lol. If it was someone who I loved with all my heart  I couldn't bare to see them be killed  so yes I would. Without hesitation  because if I lived  and they didn't  my life would have less meaning  knowing they should be here and not myself. Sorry to go on a downer there  I just watched Freddies ep  what do you expect :P,0
8431, OH HELL YES!!! That would be AWESOME! Imagine how many people you could affect with your happiness? :D,0
8432, It depends on who you were :P I don't go around giving out free kisses you know ;) lol,0
8433, Thanks! Well  I just finished BUT its probably going to get messy again. So  you are welcome to pop around and wait until it gets messy again ;),0
8434, I would yeah. Even though that would be TERRIFYING to know  but if there was no way I could prevent it from happening  then I would like to make sure I spend it with the people that I love. I couldn't bare dying when there are people who don't know how much I care about them. Its an important issue to me  which is why I always try to tell people  as much as possible how much I care. You never know when something could happen right? So its best to make sure you do the things that you really would need to before something happened :( Morbid! lol,0
8435, I would like to live in some parts of America yes. Only because its CHEAPER THAN HERE  the people seem more friendly than here  its hotter (in certain parts) and what can I sayyy? Everyone loves the USA :),0
8436, The devil is hot. SMOKINNNN'!!!!,0
8437, Good things :) Because good things can be interesting things too  depending on how you look at them. BUT interesting things  can be bad things  and that sucks :( So good things :) Besides  they make you happy  and you can never have enough 'goodness' :D,0
8438, Good Looking I think. Just because being rich can attract the wrong crowd all together! I wouldn't want to be popular because of my money and I know there are crowds that are drawn to that. I would rather be popular for being me  and being good looking certainly adds to that. There was something on the TV I watched once  and they said that better looking people are more likely to be employed for a job than uglier ones. This is because  when they see someone who is attractive in how they dress  hair etc  it shows they are self caring and someone who doesn't take much effort in their appearance  could show that they aren't willing to give much effort in that field of work. It was scientifically proven  but I think its bullshit really lol  or should be at least :),0
8439, Fall up the stairs  because at least you don't end up in a weird position on the floor :P You would end up lying on the stairs  feet first  so it protects your dignity if wearing a skirt ;) lol,0
8440, Hmmmm  it completely depends on the movie. Some things that come out and I REALLLLLLLLLLY want to see  then definitely cinema  just to get the whole interpretation right  eg sound  big screen  atmosphere etc. But  if its something that Im not too worried about  but I would still like to watch it. I would probably buy it on DVD and cuddle up in the comfort of my own home :) It does completely depend on the movie though  and the people I was to watch it with ;),0
8441, Hmmmm  it depends on how much effort they had to put into each of them. I mean  if someone was an artist and they painted me a picture  it wouldn't mean so much if say a writer painted me a picture. Or vice versa  if a writer wrote me a poem or an artist wrote me a poem  that one would mean more. Its all about which one took the most effort and concentration to do  you know what I mean? :D,0
8442, Partner who is extremely difficult. Just because  living alone  its going to leave you depressed anyway  no one truly likes to live alone. So at least  someone who could be difficult  at least they would make you feel something. Even if one minute it was passion  the next anger  its better to feel something over nothing. I would choose the harder option  because no one deserves to be alone :),0
8443, Can't I just be the person at the bottom who moves the foam about?,0
8426, I actually would yes :D I would love to in fact! There are a lot of issues with cost and time though. Would you ever visit me? :P,0
8425, Only if I had recently been to the dentist.,0
8424, I do like the idea of a double barreled name actually. Losing your name  is probably quite sad  but there again  changing your name is really really exciting  knowing you are part of the family of your loved one. So a combination of both  bringing both families together :) What do you think?,0
8423, This is annoying it didn't appear :( How many others aren't appearing too :'( Anyway  to re-answer :) I think its quite sad when you change your name  only because I see it (kind of) as a way that you are giving up on your family and ditching them for a new one. BUT  I also see it as a wonderful way  when you gain someone elses name  because you are being accepted into your loved ones family  and thats awesome <3 So to solve all  I actually like double barreled names :) You don't give up your own  but you still gain your loved ones. Its like bringing both families together  rather than dropping or gaining  you get both :) How about you?,0
8405, Because it pushes the power out? I feel you are trying to catch me out here missy :P,0
8406, I think someone was probably holding the map upside down when they named the places :(,0
8407, Ohhh you don't! You just drive with your hand out the window  and GRABBBB! Stopping is for oldies ;),0
8408, I don't think I get this one either. Thats an epic fail...whats wrong with me today? :S,0
8409, I didn't know that drug dealers called their clients users? Or is that some joke that im not getting? lol Also ho's call their clients users ;),0
8410, Because when you aren't in control  anything can happen  and thats rather scary. Things can look up  or things can go to shit. Having that sense of control  at least gives you a grip on the car while it is moving...,0
8411, Because babies actually sleep really well :) Its humans that are the problem. The babies are asleep  BUT because the parents are driven insane by constant 'baby-like' things  they hallucinate and THINK the baby is up. As a matter of fact  its still sleeping. I think its parents with the issues  never children...,0
8412, Hmmm  good question. Never thought about that before. Perhaps because when we look at things through water  because of magnification  things appear closer and/or a different shape (eg a pencil appears bent). The magnification and density of the water  fragments the light thus giving it a different appearance or colour? I don't know  just a suggestion lol,0
8445, I would say you are Louise. Whatever that means.,0
8413, Concentration dude! You will understand when you eventually drive :P The music can be pretty distracting  so its a way of making sure you actually find the place :P I don't know if it helps mind you...,0
8415, Because its thinner  and they thought  &quot;if we start with the thinner numbers  we will know how much space we have to make the fatter ones&quot;. Thats why the 0 isn't like a O. Its more squashed  because they were losing space.,0
8416, Its to emphasis the point of an abbreviation :P By using the word  it makes you want to do it... see ;) Its self publicity lol :P,0
8417, Its such a shame. I thought I was special  knowing you were just 'doing your job'  its heartbreaking ;),0
8418, Hmm  im going to be awkward and say both ;) because you can be beautiful and learn to be a wiser person  but there is no past being ugly lol.,0
8419, Ummm  its hard to pin point things. I don't really know if im honest. I get walked over A LOT by people  so I suppose just being taken advantage of.  Sometimes I do things for people (family  friends etc) and I don't really feel gratitude for it. So I suppose  putting in loads of effort to something  and it not being appreciated is a slap in the face :(,0
8420, Retro songageeeeeeeeee...,0
8421, I have no clue where thats from  but I just googled it  and it came up with &quot;emo lyrics&quot;! HAHA! You got your answer ;),0
8422, Of course. Sharing is good  sharing is nice  sharing solves all. Unless you are Cook/Freddie ;),0

1866, my parents turned the lights out on my sister and i when we watch the newest Texas Chainsaw Masacare in Theaters. They said they went up to the store...but they didnt  they stayed to torment us...and we thought we were really being attacked or something. My dad crawled in the window.... all the lights off. he made the breaker trip...and we heard cracking floor noises in the kitchen..about shit our pants. all i had was a hanger and thought if anyone had to do anything it'd be me....r So of course i finally made myself around the corner of our room and the lights came back on....not too much later there was nocking on our window and like the dumb crazy person in the movie that you wanna scream at for not just leaving the window alone  i threw up the blinds to see my Dad's face plastered up against the window and hands up scaring me half to death!!! It was awful. I was mad at my dad for like the next 2 or 3 days. hahaha i cried and yelled and i was only like 13 but still. hahhaa it was good.,0
1856, I dont really get embarrassed much. It takes a lot. and i mean a lot. lol I just dont care really what people think and i like to make people laugh so it works in my favor :]r r But i would have to say  for most people...they would find this embarrassing. I was on a family vaca Woowhoo in the smokies  and we stopped on the side of the road to hang out in a creek and i sooo had to take a crap. We were nowhere close to anything and I did in the woods on the side of the road. And of course people pulled right infront of my parents mini and got out to come down in the creek too. I dont think anyone saw me but that was potentially embarrassing. haha My family found it hilarious.,0

1887, There is no perfect lol but I suppose with a funny guy-polite  random and spontaneous  maybe a night out at a 70's club and dress up go to dinner before. haha that'd be fun!! :),0
1888, Spontaneousness. As much as I love to get all dressed up and go out to a big super nice expensive restuarant  I'd much rather just be in comfy clothes  go out to grab some chipotle--eating outside of course :] then maybe to the drive in with a buncha snackies and a jug of tea :] lay together with my lovee under the stars and enjoy each other.,0
1889, Florida :] always.r But i wanna see the grand canyon.,0
1890, If it isn't broken  don't try to fix it :],0
1891, They don't feel. Theyre are wayy to many people in this world that don't truly care if they hurt anothers feelings. And its like it makes them feel better about themself. But in reality  they're only insecure about something they have to deal with  whether it be personally or physically or emotionally..just because your not happy with yourself  doesn't mean you should try to make others feel worse about themselves. But that is just my opinion and what do I know. Friendliness only gets a slap in the face more often than not. :] pass it on haha,0
1892, baptist.,0
1893,7 1/2,0
1894, aries.,0
1896, blah,0

1833, hes sweet to me and willing to do anything for me. but hes very selfish when it comes to being truely selfless sometimes.,0
1774, people.,0
1775, itll only get harder. get on with it,0
1776, answer to both please :) r I think guys need to pull up thier pants. period. r I believe its sluttyly uncalled for for the thongs hanging out. Keep them in ya scrubbies. Period.,0
1777, I think it's no different than a woman to hit a man than a man to hit a woman  first of all. But up foremost  I believe that If a man is willing to hit a female  whom is half the size  half the strength  half the fury  then the man is half of what a real man is. He's gotta make up for something else if he feels the need to take advantage of a being thats smaller and weaker that themselves or thier own. r r Hence don't think im not a feminist like all other strong figured  well headed  a female can do anything a man can do  but lets face reality and we can't. So when it comes down to it  theres nooo reason a male should ever hit another female. Ever.,0
1778, Irresponsible. Your correct. I think theres  a time to party and a time to grow and and realize that your an adult now. its time for the party to be over!,0
1779, I think the same with all substance abuse while mothers are pregnant. IT SHOULDN'T BE USED!!!!! Not drinking  smoking cigs  pot  coke  shooting up  blahh tee blahh...its all the same. Dont do it. I think its very immature  selfish and uncaring for the unborn. They have no choice but to rely on the mother. NO CHOICE. SO as a mother  YOU should make the right choice for them.,0
1780, its dumb,0
1781, Ewwwwwweyy.,0

I would hate it if I couldnt' bare my own child. that would be really hard. and i would probably pray my guts out before going the other route but if its enivetable then I guess I would adopt.

1797, knowing when your time to die is,0
1798, Okay Im super glad you asked me this question  only because its a common misconception about hiccups. Your not supposed to hold your breath. The reason you have hiccups in the first place  is lack of oxygen. So the usual hold your breath till your face turns blue and still keep holding it  isn't what makes them go away. Its the deep breath you take after holding your breath :]r r So to relieve my hiccups  I hold my breath ;) haha only to take a bigger breath afterward.,0

1671, thats really a hard question. and to be honest i dont think i could care for the amount of children that are being abused and self sacrifice my entire life for them. thats really harsh and makes me sound awful but that exact senario is happening next to my parents house and when i was about 18 i thought that is something i would have been willing to do but now i see them and how far they are that it would almost be mear unfair and unsuccessful on my part for them. its all they know. and if the state wont do anything its sad to say but what could i do by ripping them from the only home they do know and tell them its all wrong. i guess im not that selfless. and its like 12 kids. so that would be a lot. idk. but rightnow  i dont think so. just because im not in any way capable of taking care of them any better rightnow anyways. other than the not abusing them but whats worse?,0

Perhaps how if we want to take over an entire country we can make sure we do so  but when it comes to third world starving countries..well we can only send so much food.r Another would be how we control missles by satelite and split atoms to destroy anything we want but we cant stop this oil spill. Ohh no. Its out of our control.r &amp;&amp; I guess the inhumane way of growing all our food supplies is something to overlook as well. Only being that the animals literally cant think  move  do anything ut produce giagantic chicken breasts and stand in their own poop their entire life till the stock yards. Sooo its way out of our hands for that as well. r All these things need to be asked to our 'Oh SO lets make a change' president because the way I see it  theres no changes only what the government cares about is what is necessary. and that is wrong.,0
1714, The most major flaw in our Justice system are the corrupt people behind the surface that keeps the system running for the wrong reasons. Using the government as a face for greed  selfishness  caring less for the good for humanity and getting ahead before another country. r Sadly  we can't make them more stable. There will always be corrupt in the system-therefore never allowing the good for human kind to prosper in the end. Never. Just my opinion though  what do I know.,0
1715, 1. I am totally able to telepathically read others minds.r 2. Im a fairy in this world here to spread my sparkles in someone elses life.r 3. I can drink an entire gallon of OJ in one drink. r 4. I can make a mess like nobodys business.r 5. Sometimes I eat in my dreams and am so full I don't have to eat for days. r 6. I can change the weather with my emotion alone. :],0

2434, Lol haha how cute is tht? Juss keedingg(:,0
2192, yes,0
2193, because they dont care,0
2194, i have no idea. nothing else to do in life..,0
2195, because they have nothing better to say,0
2196, yes,0
2197, I've soooo wondered that too!,0
2198, he shaves.,0
2191, nothing else to do in life.,0
2199, idk . good question.,0
2201, idk dude. why do you call so much haha,0
2202, idk. people have nothing else to concern themselves with other than what they can pick apart from other people. its a way to take attention off of their own flaws i believe.,0
2203, i have no idea. but its prolly because of where our priorities lay.... compared to the others that dont think. where are theirs?,0
2204, control issues i guesss,0
2205, i didnt know it was,0
2206, I have no idea. Haven't seen the commerical.,0
2207, Idk really. I never get hate on here?! :/,0
2200, causes they can't have violence in the kids show. come on you knew that..hahah,0
2190, because they have nothing smarter to say,0
2189, because there is nothing else to do.,0
2188, hope that it'll work? haha,0
2171, do they die after a week :(,0
2172, Comfortness.,0
2173, I dont. and yes i see what your saying but not really cause guys are different than how we think. I think it more the forbidden territory to them so that's why they get so turned on when thinkin about doing it in the butt. haha Just don't do it  if your not comfortable doing it.,0
2174, To make life a little less inconvient for the every day hot dog eater.,0
2175, We're all Human. its in some ours genetics i believe.,0
2176, the perks of being human i persume.,0
2177, excuse to stand out about something,0
2178, because so many people revolve they're lives around their cellulars. its pathetic really.,0
2179, I think there are always reasons. of course ;],0
2180, Because they feel they have noone else that will love them. but truly i dont understand why people do that?? its very confusing to me. There's only about a biazillion people in this world that you can meet and fall in love with...why end it for one individual. theres so much more out there!,0
2181, thats a good question. r I don't understand that either. because this world is all backwards and people say all kinds of things that they dont mean but it doesnt mean they will do what they say. beauty of being a human. say what comes out of your mouth but your body does what your mind thinks  not what your mouth says.,0
2182, Gravity.....?,0
2183, Cause they'll get more stale and soft. Duhhhhh?,0
2184, because your supposed to look up and be aware something is going to potentially hit you in the head..therefore i do look up just quickly and aware!! you should do the same. think about it! :),0
2185, reaction. its weird but  i love it haha,0
2186, It was mostly how i was raised and how i like to act myself. personally i like the way i am :],0
2187, i dont mind it because it gives me questions i guess,0
2208, i dont think so?,0
2209, Because I want to ask you questions!!!! DONT DELETE your formspring!! :{,0
2210, if your going to ask a question like that don't you think if im going to be honest with you  you should give me the respect of knowing who you are?,0
2212, Idk  I don't really look forward to the weekend. Just means there's another week coming ahead.,0
2234, I have already. theyr'e aswesome.,0
2235, never.,0
2236, Nahh I'd do it myself lol,0
2237, YEsH hahahahaha wouldn't you??,0
2238, No.  Would you?,0
2239, I have one actually and havent' yet but im wanting for a good reason to get it out and then i will :) we'll see what happens...ewwwwahhh eww. hahahaha,0
2240, yes,0

2245, Nahh unless i wanted to talk to someone taken from me unexpectedly.,0
2246, i have before.,0
2247, Nahh i dont think so. i like my privacy too much ;),0
2248, Of course! I sure would :),0
2249, yes,0
2250, Yes,0
2233, I believe that is a really dumb question  hence the part of me answering the last question with me saying I had a dui. thanks for the indirect insult. So i guess the answer to your question is  No not anymore but I have! damn,0
2170, because myspace is dead and FB is overrated. :) plus to expand my brain powers,0
2232, Nahhh not worth the blahhh bullcrap.,0
2230, if thats what he'd wanna do then im not doing something right. so no but that shouldnt be an issue,0
2213, nice. rub it in hahaha,0
2214, i dont like to recollect worst thing in my life.,0
2215, sour krawt. i hate that stuff for some reason.,0
2216, hahahah idk.,0
2217, yes it would. it does now sometimes,0
2218, i dont believe so. only that i would help more than i do now.,0
2219, no i dont think so. i think it would prolly get lonesome watching everyone you grow to care about die and go on with out you. knowing that you'll never die.,0
2220, yes of course. i would love to be a pirate. always. errrgg.,0
2221, yes i think so,0

2168, How'd you know that  im in gym shorts currently?,0
2167, I don't know really. You ask a lot of prostitue questions though  I'll tell you that. haha i guess because they've prolly never grown up being told thats not how life should or has to be..,0

Someone who is usually insecure of themselves and have to put other people down to make themselves feel better about ones self. hahaha,0
692, I have him. My Timmy :]r He's super in everyway possible. Sweet and sensitive enough to understand but hard and can stand his ground when it comes down to it. A little over protective but only enough to show that he truly cares. He brings flowers home for me being his girlfriend day! :] If I want anything he'd get it but knows I have everything I want. Compassionate and caring and loves everything that I do. He enjoys all the same foods as I do and is open to exploring new boundaries he's never expierenced. Ohh and He let's me be crazy about things that Im so passionate about  that most guys would laugh at and make fun of. Recycling  planting flowers and smiling at people just because I want to make their day! :] He's perfect for me. He understands me in every aspect a man could. Hes sweet enough to damper my attitude and sarcasm at times but bullheaded enough to not always give in to me. Lets me whine if I want attention and holds me more than I could ever want to be held. I love him. And for me  hes my perfet guy! <3r Ohh and he's a super sexxy stud :] of course.,0

The writings on the wall  you've read that I'll be gone  but if you call my name Just know that I'll come running  for one more night to spare with you This is where I'm meant to be  please don't leave me  Iu2019ve read these stories a thousand times  and now Iu2019ll rewrite them all Youu2019re meddling in an anger you canu2019t control She means the world to me  so hold your serpent tongue Is a whores lies worth dying for? I'll just take my time  The only thing that's going to bother me Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends  Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?  The writings on the wall  you've read that I'll be gone  but if you call my name Just know that I'll come running  for one more night to spare with you This is where I'm meant to be  please don't leave me  I walked into your house this morning I brought the gun from our end table Your blood was strewn across the walls They'll find you on your bathroom floor  I walked into your house this morning I brought the gun from our end table Your blood was strewn across the walls They'll find you on your bathroom floor when I'm done  But should I write it all off? But should I write it all off? But should I write it all off? (You should have killed me when you had the chance) But should I... ? (You should have killed me when you had the chance) You should have killed me when you had the chance You should have killed me when you had the chance,0
